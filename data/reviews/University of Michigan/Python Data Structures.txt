Instructor, Dr. Chuck, is terrific.  However, assignments are incredibly difficult.  You are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course.  I spent over 100 hours alone on the assignments.  The mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all.  Very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments
The introduction is nice, but the problem is the homework design. If homework doesn't cover too much of what people learnt in class, it is easy to forget materials in class.
No teaching. Just a guy talking. Do the problem sets for 
practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out 
yourself. Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.
Again all the unnecessary talking!!! He talks a lotttttttttttttttttttt!!! Why so much of unnecessary talking? Why can't he just get to point straight away and making the video soooooooo long!!! Hate it!
too
Excellent teaching, but it's not actually free. You must pay in order to access the assignments and the professor's in-browser python sandbox.
Way too easy assignments. Only good for people who never did any kind of programming. For the rest it's not worth the money.
Very boring old fashion academic course, i wouldn't pass it if i wasn't heavily relying on another courses
Totally not worth having the certificates.
Easy assignments.Good for people who never programmed before.
Terrible support on this course. I had to drop because of the horrible assignments. Not recommended.
Poor. Even courses taught in computer science in developing countries are better than this.
WHY ASSIGNMENT (WEEK-2 OPENING TOOL) DOESN'T END??FOR THAT, I CAN'T FINISH THIS COURSE
It does not touch Hash table or Stack. Just the common data type in python.
I have to complete the same assignments as the previous course.
The editor was pretty terrible 0/10 would not recommend
More fluff than actually learning.
Not very informative of engaging.
Got charged without free trial.
Time & money wasting. Rubish
make the other ones free
Too basic for programers
It has too many bugs.
Teacher is not good
Bored me to death!
This course is too much about text and have a lot of  data structures, which I found to be non useful for majority of users.
The course is really trivial. Maybe I was expecting so much, but the material is really to  simple. Also there are a lot of material which lector things is fun and cool, but it is really anoying.  Please, try to focus more on programming instead of being cool and fun.  Thanks for understanding.
bonous videos are not good
Unlike the very first course for beginners, there is a little bit more content here, so I put 2 stars. However, I still found the pace was too slow, with too much distraction ("funny" videos, teacher drinking and making mistakes, hummm !!!). It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses, not 5 (with the capstone). I am planning to move forward with Python, and to keep reading the booklet which is good (I like the introduction about the HTTP, XML, JSON and SQL databases) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation, it is overpriced for what it is !!
As an experienced programmer, I am unimpressed.  The assignments cover a good set of tools; file i/o, lists, dictionaries, et cetera.  I would introduce classes before getting into data structures; this would emphasize the critical elements of modularity and reusability.  Also, variables and files are poorly named.  Comments are lacking.  Overall, the presentation looks rushed and unpolished.  Code looks like it was hobbled together until it worked and never edited for clarity.  If someone I cared about wanted examples of good programming, I would tell them to avoid this.
Could have been much as better as compared to the earlier course(Getting started with Python)Charles Severance is a great teacher with immense energy That's why I expected more from this 2nd course.But it's okayI might revise the course concepts by myselfThank You
The course is good but the website is not working properly most of the times.Video is not at all loading and it is showing error.if this situation continues then the course will not be utilized by the students.please solve this issue and make videos available.
I like the lecture but I have a concern about the platform, which doesn't allow to debug. The indentation issue happened multiple times that you would have to move all the lines to the left or return to the last line to start over.
The course is an introduction to the absolute basics of python. Programming assignments are not very challenging and the course could benefit by adding more content and challenging tasks for those who wish to challenge themselves.
I don't know why some of my assignments are locked and i'm getting this message "This item will be unlocked when the session begins. "I am requesting staff members, please try to unlock these assignments.
Although whatever I learnt was important, I think it could have been bundled up with the first course, since it doesn't take that much time to complete or understand them.
too short, too much irrelevant information (like the videos about professor travelling and ordering a taco in Mexico). I do not recommend this course.
a bit boring and doesnt relate to anything i do at work yet. but some others may find it usefull i guess
Some of the concepts were really taught hard, can be explained in an elaborative way.
the topics should be explained more in details with some complex real-time examples
you have not explained the full details but asked the questions out of the course
this course should be renamed to "python basic data types"
The pre-written code in the assignments is not so good.
Dr. Chuck is amazing. Im to dumb to code
Course moved a little too slowly
an easy one
Assignments are harder than the examples in the lecture. The TA doesn't help much. The TA is wasting my time and driving me crazy.Whenever I ask a question, the TA answers like: why did you put blabla into blabla? But this still makes me confusing, he didn't answer why this is wrong, and what to do to fix it.
I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching. It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long. After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification. Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course. I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^
Not enough exercise unfortunately + no correction of the assignments!I think as well that the video format is not always great, it makes it difficult to find specific content in a course
Way too expensive for its contents
The book really gave more details about the individual chapters. Hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videos.I recommend that specializations should follow this trend, so students who find it difficult to access Internet can use the book as a guide.More examples are needed to understand the concepts especially Tuples and DIctionary
Teaching staff was not helpful & then rude. I asked for help & could not get. When I get help for free from colleagues, my assignment was turned down because it did not meet what was taught. It was a single line to remove duplicates. Yet, I could program this whole thin in Alteryx faster & cleaner than this course.
This one was challenging. This was my first programing class and it forced me out of my comfort zone. I do feel like it all came together and I can semi competently write short scripts now. Allot of the exercises were a real push, we used code we were taught but in different ways. It forced me to understand the code more than if I just copied it. I do wish there were more exercises so I can get more practice in a situation that I can check my answers.I think it would be very useful to provide a key terms sheet. Even if we don't understand all the terms in context its useful to know what words we should be paying attention to. Sometimes I found the teacher saying item this and item that. I'm still not sure if I should call variables; items, variables, or something else. I am convinced we did not have enough information to solve the week 4 problem (8.4). I had to go way outside the course and find information that I hadn't been taught in order to solve it. Additionally the teacher talks really fast which makes it very hard to follow along with especially while I'm trying to write down the code.
Wish there were more opportunities for creative and critical thinking. I was tolerant of the first course's hand holding nature but was disappointed to see that the same teaching style followed into the second course. The assignments don't require much thought to complete, its basically  the same problem that was solved in the video lectures. As a result, you can away with a lot of copy / paste code provided from the video lectures. To me this proves that the assignment problems were TOO similar to the problems / solutions discussed in the video lectures. Would have loved to see more challenging problems. Because in my opinion, challenging problems and finding ways to solve them are the essence of computer programming. Although, I can't give the course too bad a review. I very much affirm the mission the professor embarks. I can't entirely dislike a course that introduces people to the world of computer programming, a very worthwhile cause to dedicate yourself too.
This is my second course of Python in this sequence.   I'm trying to 
follow the sequence they give.  I liked it.  I still believe there could
 be some more rigor in the program.  As in, many of these weeks only 
have one program due.  And, if you have a decent idea of programming, 
paid attention, etc., the programs really aren't that difficult.  I 
believe 1-2 more programs each week would increase the rigor of the 
course and, thus, provide us with more work, allowing us to build more 
confidence, with our Python computer skills.

I do like the videos a lot.  They connect very well with the problems.  I
 like the quizzes at the end of the chapters, also.  I enjoy the "extra"
 videos at the end of each chapter, but they really aren't needed.

I feel just the rigor of the course needs to improve.  But, would I take a course formatted like this again?  Yes, definitely.
After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric. Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course.
The instructor was GREAT GREAT. This course gives me the idea how I can use Python in real life. The assignments are more challenging than the Getting started with Python Course which is good for the learner. But the teaching staff ruined my experience here so I deducted 2 stars out. For those of you considering to take this course, do it but keep in mind that some rude replies from teaching staff may happen here.
Loved data structures concept and the way professor explained. But i feel the exercise needs to be more challenging. Just 1 assignment for each topic is not enough and they are very light. Only one tuple exercise where we don't do much with it. Also the grader questions are very easy should be more challenging. I have no prior knowledge of python i was able to breeze through.
Hello,The course has been designed in a way which can help a person who doesn't even know Programming. I do appreciate that!But, just one question that I have is, why the deadlines for the Assignments are designed in such a way that Week1 of Introduction Course, and the Advanced (Object Oriented Programming) have the same deadline?
could have been better ,the previous course ,getting started with python was good but this was not up to the mark,the instructor left many things in topic of lists,tuples,files and dictionaries. students are left with little knowledge and they can not apply that on their own to write their programs
This course might be ideal if you never heard about programming. Otherwise the lecturer speaks to much over every single point and does not progress in the topics. The python programming tool is really a mass and uses very old pyhon syntax. This should be updated!
Please make the exercises a bit more challenging as the programmes were way too easy and could be solved very quickly without much challenge.Overall its very good and a perfect chance for new learners to learn programming .Overall it was quite a good experience.
but in these courses there is no pre-knowledge given about keywords like in,not in,is,reverse etc.So they are not in order and its frustrating sometimes ,so it will be great if you can add some study material about it in course itself,it will help
it was a great course but not all topics are covered of data structures it is just the overview of data structure the instructor should add more topics to make it more relevant for the students to cover the all parts of data structures .
I believe the course material is not adequate for solving coding assignment and there should be done more improvements in the code editor as same code works on VisualStudio code but it shows indentation error in python playground.
Data structure is the second course in Python specialization. This module covers only list, dictionary, and tuple. Instructor was very helpful but the course is meant to be very fundamental and beginner-friendly.
A good course for starters. But for those who want to lay a solid foundation for python like me with this course, the material taught in each lecture is far from enough, and should be more arranged.
Nice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignments.Hope quizzes were better in standard.
Fair course. Severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles. Learned a lot from the course.
It may be the purpose of the course or the specialization, but I've been finding it too easy. I wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice.
Honestly felt like the explanation and examination of data structures was cursory at best.  A more detailed review of this aspect of Python programming is probably more appropriate.
The coding assignments seems too simple and largely out-of-date, some python3 syntax are not supported, like "in" and standard solutions are somewhat low-efficient and rigid.
Actually some time i lose my motivation ... i don't know why, i think the professor doesn't meet my interest of learning.  By the way the way of how he teach is good.
Probably good for anyone coming from a non-programmer background.If you're a programmer, can learn everything in a few hours just by looking at any Python tutorial.
Bonus material is very annoying. Can you please give external links to these so that we dont HAVE TO watch it in order to get 100% completion? Please?
expected more detailed topics. such as more usages of functions and more exercises.However, I like the way he explains. it was fun to do this course
i need more examples and method explanations, apart from that, this course is excellent. i recommended to everyone to learn  and improve your skills
I was expecting this course to delve more in depth in data structure and data mining techniques.... It seemed too short to be worth 7 weeks.
Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.
Not enough exercises. Better have at least 10 programming exercises for each week. More difficult material = more exercises.
The more solving example should be provided for a better understanding. Nevertheless, it was a good course for beginners.
This Python data Structure Course was helpful in providing the basic elegantly But this course could introducing Trees
Information given is quite basic. Moreover would be better to have some optional exercise of higher difficulty level.
concepts are explained clearly with examples but there are some topics which are left that are given in the book .
Its good course if you're a fast learner and there are many key points covered in this course which are useful
some topic in data structures suchas set has been left and it will be effective if more assignments are given
Simple and good but not including regular expressions as part of data structure course  was bit too harsh.
Somewhat dissapointed that only the built in Datastructures were discussed and done so with too much time.
simple and easy for Python beginners, the instructor also has a textbook that could be good instruction.
It's better than the first course of the series, but there is room for some more difficult assignments.
well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone.  Why did Coursera split it to another course?
The assignments are very hard for beginners. The assignments should in stages from easy to hard.
the probmlems and graded assignments were tougher as compared to the the ones taught in class
This course lacked content and is not at all worth paying for the certificate for this one.
doctor didn't mention some features of some built in function like range(start:end:step)
Assignment  little bit difficult as compare to content.otherwise everything is good
Exercises are too few and easy. I don't feel like I've really mastered the content.
Interesting, but the assignments were a bit dull. Learned a bit more about python.
Not exactly what I was looking for. More rigorous coding questions are warranted
I was unable to communicate well with the mentors and it really slowed me down.
Not enough repetition in the way of homework.  Expected a more rigorous course.
I appreciate it, but I've experienced better ways of teaching programming
Need bit tough assignments. Please increase the standard of assignments.
Content Wise it is very short Course but teaching skill was interesting
Not a challenge course. Not better than learn python the hard way.
not as good as part one but certainly intersting due to dr chuck
The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.
It's a good course to learn about data structures for beginers.
Too easy, to much given for free, no need to think for myself.
Classes still pretty good, but there is not enough exercises.
Course is with fast pace with very few exercises and examples
Nice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level!
a little bit easy, I guess this course is for the beginners.
Classes Should be More Detailed with problems and resources
good explanation of list and dictionaryexercises are good
to simple, not sure enough practice to be good at python
MAke this a bit fast paced but one of the best courses
It is a good course for beginners in Python language.
More topics should be covered......Otherwise best!!!
I think the course should include a little project.
Access to assignments and grades should be given.
Good to build python basic data the concept clear
Decent course. Could be put together a lot nicer.
nice course to learn data structures.thank you
good course, a little difficult assignments.
Too easy for someone who knows to programme.
Need Advance Level Questions for Assignment
It misses a lot of examples and excercices
Very basic and does not cover too in-depth
it wasn't that great course as i expected.
lecture is great, but I need more homework
not as I was expected but not so bad also
Content not presented in a logical order.
This time explanation wasn,t that simple
The content of knowledge is a bit small.
I expected more challenging questions...
easy way to teach python data structure
Prefer to have more hands-on exercises.
need more knowledge to understand this
is there any chinese subtitle version?
not enough theoretical explanation
Little bit slow and meandering.
More content can be put in.
Good learning experience..
Needs to cover a bit more
IT WAS QUITE CHALLENGING
videos Are too lengthy.
this course was OKAY!
It's very useful
very challenging
a little hard
was hard
I took the course as my foundation in python programming. It helped me 
learn some oops concepts as well as data structures. The bonus material 
is a plus for unmasking about why developers developed a particular 
thing. The course is somewhat basic and easy to understand. Thanks to 
Professor Chuck for making it understandable and a wonderful experience 
for students. The fact which i didn't like about this course is it is 
too basic and not much practically viable for students but it good for 
making fundamentals in python.
Pros:Dr Chuck is an incredible person, he tries to ease you through the language learning by being the opposite of casual. The themes don't focus on math or been too deep, but rather be "functional". There are tutors to help you, and that makes this course extremely important although I didnt use them once in this second course. I was able to figure it out just by trying it out as he always said. Most courses have poor material for you to follow, this is not the case, even though dr Chuck made a brand new book for the entire series and thats very useful. No more note taking, instead try all he explains on your own and see how it works and get used to typing them.Cons:In everything there is always improvement, and sadly the course cannot elude that. Although I love the lectures, its too much. Once you finish them, you dont remember well how to write anything in order to solve the problem. And thats why I was saying the Pros, that one has to type in all he says in order to get used to writing code and seeing how it works. After 30 or so min of lectures, even 17 min, you find yourself that you are not prepared to solve the assignments because you think you have a memory issue. The fact is that, the ONLY improvement is to make more mini quizzes between concepts, and very short assignments and then the usual 2 homeworks to pass each week. That would be just perfect.
Great course! I started learning Python for the first time, and It is also basically my first programming language experience. The videos, explanations and examples are very good, well structured and easy to understand. However I miss more practical exercises and more worked videos with the solutions specially after the week 5 when the subject gets a bit more complicated. Perhaps the solutions should be locked/unlocked after students submit their solutions ?! I don't know if that is possible but that would be great, specially for students who wants to continue with this specialization. Also for the record, I am a mom of a 5 year old that is only part time in the kindergarten, and I was able to successfully complete the course. I hope that can be used as a motivation for all students out there, independent of your age or your background, you can learn how to program! :D
This course challenged me to learn to apply my Python skills in new ways beyond simply reperforming the work done in the lectures. This is critical to making the knowledge imparted in the lectures your own. The material was very engaging, easily digestible, and easy to navigate in partnership with the free ebook. My only criticism is that I think the assignments given could have stretched me a little more - or maybe, it would have been cool to have some optional assignments wherein you apply knowledge just learned with a novel twist requiring you to utilize knowledge from prior lectures in unexpected ways. I fear that even by completing the assignments I may still not have great retention and understanding in truly flexible ways, but I know that's on me to continue my learning and thereby reinforcing the concepts imparted by this class.
Great introductory course. I have some experience in programming (not a professional programmer though) and finished this course during one working day, but found it really useful for those who wants to learn programming from the scratch or wants to move to Python from another language.It would be really great to include more assignments, and may be make them more difficult (for example in algorithm series every assignment took at least one hour to complete and some took 20-25 hours to get the full score). End here i spent about 10 minutes for the most difficult exercise. Hope to finish a whole specialization in a week or two and dig deeper to a data science.The thing that I miss much in this course is a peer assessment, add it and the course usefulness will raise over the moonThanks!
I really enjoyed the course and I'm planning to finish all the other courses. Dr. Chuck is awesome I liked how he explained the materials, especially that I have no background in Python. I entered this course because I was curious about programming and I want to learn a new skill. However, I need to mention that I struggled to finish the assignments I wish if they were explained more in detail. Even though there were videos that explain some of the assignments I still struggled to finish the assignments it was a bit confusing. Dr. Chuck does advise us to take another intro course in Python if we still don't understand the coding. On the other hand, I did really well on the quizzes. I hop with taking more courses I will become more comfortable using Python.
Dr. Chuck's explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow: focus on relevant web technologies, perfect pace, examples based on popular APIs. As someone with some basic knowledge in programming already I was expecting the assignments to be more challenging. As clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher: all exercises can be solved in about 10-15 lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking. The rest of you will, like me, breeze through it in no time. Kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material!
Again like in Getting Started with Python course, I wish there was a way for us to get explanations for quiz questions after we complete a quiz, so we can fully understand them.  I wish we could have something similar for when we complete the coding assignments, the worked exercises are helpful, but it would be helpful after we complete an assignment to have a code to compare ours to, to see the differences and to make sure we understand exactly what Dr. Chuck was getting at.  There were several assignments that I completed, but not in the correct way, so the next weeks assignment was more difficult than it should have been.
The first course was really well explained. This was good too, but it was fast paced for a beginner. The course description clearly states that even people with no programming background should be able to complete this easily. I felt that the dictionaries and the tuples part of this course was explained too quickly. Depended on google for more detailed explanation to understand those concepts. I hope you do take this into consideration, since the difficulty level for this course is given as "easy" in the description.
It was great learning about data structures like Lists and dictionaries. The content of this course in comparison to the previous one was much more difficult and hard to understand and thus more challenging. I order to do the tough assignments I also had to go through more basic stuff of this programming language which eventually helped me polish my knowledge of the syntax and semantics of Python programming language. Yes, I did finish the course, but still, I require a lot of practice to get fluent with the steps.
I am just finishing this second course (Data structures) in the python for everybody specialization. It is really interesting knowing this data structures used in python, the exercises teach you the utility of those special data structures, the way of teaching of Dr. Chuck helps you to better understand and to digest the subjects. I found this second part still requiring low effort level, I hope the difficulty increase in next courses. (I hope I am no regretting  of saying that during my coming homework)
This is an excellent course! I learnt a lot from this course. Just a bit of advice: lots of materials are irrelevant (office hours etc. - even Dr. Chuck on motocross!). I know it's meant for fun, but a bit too much. When you see that you're supposed to get 46 mins of videos, you wouldn't expect to actually get 17 minutes and the rest are stuffs nothing to do with competence build-up. But still, the lectures are interesting and definitely there are lots of takeaways from this course. Thank you!
I am sincerely grateful to Dr. Chuks and Coursera for this opportunity. I have always been interested in mastering python and I am happy that I have completed 2 of many courses to earn a specialization degree. The highlight of this course is delivery and humor that was used in preparing and delivering the classes. Dr. Chuks ensured he explained the tit bits before diving into the deep aspect. The course is just too awesome. Kudos to Dr. Chuks and UMichigan. Hope to join Michigan soonest.
Good course. Better than the first course. In the first course, the course was fully focused at beginners but this course is fully focused on people with prior coding experience. So i recommend to make the courses balanced. Easy to learn for people with experience in programming but beginners will find the assignments to be very tough. Good instructor but talks unnecessary things than the topic too much. Other than that the course was perfect for people with experience in coding.
Very good course. The last week's lesson on Tuples seemed pretty straightforward, but the last assignment seemed to require "stretching" a bit beyond the material outlined in the videos. I eventually got the answer, but felt a little bewildered and surprised at first as all previous weeks had lecture material and reading that made it rather easy to complete the assignments! I suspect subsequent courses in this specialization will be harder! Overall, this was a great course though
Awesome course, maybe I'm not giving myself enough time to digest one topic before jumping to another as I needed to refer past topic often, open sourced pdf version of book helped a lot.I wanted to know if it is possible to generated dictionary from two seperate list, and it is possible! I was able to zip two list to form a list of tuple and then used dict() method to form a dict... Might not be important but I felt the course will come a full roung when these are covered.
Thank you for the interesting course!One thing that this course lacks, in my opinion, is the division of the lecture material in smaller parts. It is easier to proceed, when the videos are about 7-10 minutes long, than 20-30. You can always stop in between those parts without the need to remember the last minute of the video you watched and also to feel closure, since the part has been checked as completed.Thanks again! I wish your course improves and stays successful!
The course is excellent. The platform has some aspects not so good - some parts still don't show up as 'done', so the progress line is always wrong. Also, the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series, leaving the dates etc wrong. Chapter 1 and 2 should ideally show up as completed, as theey are repeated in every module (which is fine, but the platform should take care of those members who have done these in a previous module?
No doubt that this is a very helpful course for a beginner to learn Python. I would love to solve more assignments. Even if all the assignments are not graded, its fine but just for sake of practice let students like me solve more of them.Dr. Chuck explains all the topics very nicely. I would request him to go a little deep in topics. By way of example, it would have been great if he taught us the mechanism in which data is stored in Dectionaries (Hashing).
Chuck as usual has been great and would suggest that the examples being covered should provide a full blown syntax where complexity is being covered like dictionaries, tuples should have few slides on how to create, insert, retrieve, delete, sort, parse, etc - though some are covered but syntax has to be learnt by the students. With the above slight change it will be useful I believe for future students. Thank you Chuck you really have the knack to teach
Really enjoyed this class. Dr Chuck is an amazing instructor and his textbook is very good for the novice programmer. I felt like this class could have used a few more examples now that we're getting into more complex exercises and concepts. For example, I really struggled on the final assignment though I used the textbook and worked exercises extensively. Nevertheless I think the Coursera format is great and I will continue to take more Python classes.
I really wanted to like this course but unfortunately it lacks something essential. Programming is not something you know, it is something you do, like hitting a forehand in tennis. As such it needs much repetition and practice which is something the course does not provide. I completed all the assignments and quizzes with 100% score and yet I still have very little confidence in myself with this area of python. Please add many practice exercises.
After completion of this course you will be familiar wit the pyhthon data structures,like (list,string,dictionary).i am not telling that you will master python for all time but ya you will come across half of the way.the course instructor is very good and the video content is quite good but if you want to get some extra stuff you can go for book provided although my openion is you should go for extra problems other than the material provided.
The Professor is excellent and very student-friendly, and the course material is very clear.Two issues though:1) List comprehensions should be introduced. They are extremely powerful and should really be introduced at this stage.2) Charging $79 for this course seems like poor value for money, specially for a student like me. It doesn't go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5-6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high.
This course felt much more structured than the first course in the specialization (which is only appropriate given the course title). Dr Chuck is as personable as ever but the slightly longer lectures allow a bit more development. The only slight area for improvement might be in having some more challenging assignments--if you follow the lectures carefully and work though the examples that are shown the assignments are fairly straightforward.
Great course. Free material available on website PY4E. But a lot of deatils are missing in the video lectures but are present in Dr. Chuck's Online HTML Book. A lot of details along with great examples are the reason why this course excels at delivering its contents successfully. But, since its a beginners course, minute details regarding certain concepts was skipped out. Nonetheless, it was great course and I highly recommend it too.
The course was pretty good and the professor was really cool.Now speaking in details this course will give a very basic idea about python . So as mentioned by the professor "This is just the beginning...". And since i already had some knowledge about other programming languages it was pretty easy for me. Would love to learn more about python.Thank you sir, for making such a wonderful course on python.Love from India,Kolkata.
It was excellent and I like the way Charles Severance. As mentioned, this course will set the expectations and its not same as previous course as this course sets the bar to the next level. So 100% concentration is required. I like the way the course is designed and professor has spent time/critical information on what is required for this course. I bet you would continue to take up other course on the same track.
This continues Dr. Chuck's easing into Python. It's a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource. The existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isn't really stressed, which is unfortunate as it's helpful. About the only thing I'd appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity.
Often on Quora, I'm answering questions like https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-to-start-with-for-a-beginner/answer/Ron-Barak-1. I've upgraded my answer to point to this course. - as a good introductory course for Python beginners.I rated the course only 4/5, as I'd like to have (maybe optional)  quizzes/assignments which are a bit more demanding, so that even a non-beginner would feel challenged.
This course, in my opinion, has two steps towards perfection:1. the quiz questions need to have a description for the wrong answers and tell the reason why you are wrong. 2. There needs to be a step-by-step assignment for each week. It just jumps to the challenging one and puts the learner in some challenges that are not fair. I believe there need to be 2 warm-up assignments before each major one.
This was a great course, and Dr. Chuck's dedication to teaching Python is amazing. I went through the "Programming for Everybody (Python)" course and as stated in the description, this course is equivalent to the second half of the first course.  I missed that detail and would have otherwise just skipped right to the third course (Using Python to Access Web Data." Otherwise, it's a great course.
Python Data Structures is a good course and well thought out.  There are plenty of resources to help the student, my only recommendation would be that the assignments moreso force the students to use the relevant concepts rather than allowing work arounds.  I occasionally felt the homework could have been structured to more step by step steer me to use concepts from the most recent lesson.
Dr Chuck explains it very well, but sometimes the graded assignments get a bit difficult. If in the lectures, he would be able to write a program- line by line from scratch just after he has introduced the concept (and before the assignment) it would be really helpful.Overall, the course was really good and I can see that it's going to help me a lot in the future. Looking forward to more
This is a very good introduction to the ways Python can access and process data. Like its predecessor, Intro to Python, some of the methods taught will be superseded by more powerful processes later in the specialization, but these concepts are essential to understanding what's happening "under the hood". The instructor is friendly, accessible, and knowledgeable.This series is very good.
The Programming Assignments are too short and very straight forward (answers have kind of already been discussed in the lectures). So this doesn't give the chance to think something new..... Other than that, I found the course very well compiled along with the coolest instructor ever (who is one of the best I have ever seen)...... Thank you very much.... I enjoyed learning python !!
Pretty good course, it covers a good amount of knowledge base in terms of List, Dictionaries and Tuples. I would appreciate if you can include new videos, new features and variety of examples that can cover both basis and in depth concepts of the subject. Thanks again, Dr, Chuck. By the way, you are great mentor as well, please keep doing this to make this world a better community.
Great hands on problems solving. Requires that you put elements together from the lesson to complete each exercise variations. Not a thorough course but gives a very good working knowledge. This is great in combination with another course that catalogs all the features of Python. This course limits you to focus on what the end goal of the projects and exercises demand.
4/5, great class but I have to say that in the lectures, the professor claims that we should have absolutely mastery over every concept we learn for each successive course, however the class is structured in such a way as to rush us through every new concept instead of lingering to master it. This is a great intro class but it will take more to master the concepts.
Yeah I completed this course after Python For Everybody. Its very useful who really keen to learn Python. People can complete quickly those who has some knowledge about List, Dictionary, Tuples.Just you have apply some logic and some function which already taught in previous lesson or courses.This course would teach you how to apply the concept on problems.Thanks
this is a reaally good course, you can increase your python playground and knowledge using what you have learnt in Course 1 but you can also deal with more difficult types, functions, probems etc. I think that the most useful aim is to connect new arguments (like new types) with what you have already learnt trying to find a solution for more difficult problems
i rated this course with 4 stars. i did not give it 5 stars because i felt that the course was taught at a higher pace than the the first one. but it is not too fast and it is understandable to me because i already have some knowledge about python prior to this course. even others will not feel much difficulty and i recommend this course even for beginners.
Good overview. The overall set of Python courses starts to take pace here. I found that reading the PDF versions of the lectures and then focusing on the quizzes and assignments was the most efficient way to work through this. Somebody with programming background will find this easy, but it has enough meat to make it a good intro to the language. Well done!
The course is very nice and useful and I get to know about basics of data structure but in my opinion, it is necessary to add some extra points because the assignments which are given was related to the topics but they're in some advanced manner (i.e) we need to code which the instructor didn't explain only two lines. Otherwise, I'll give a 5-star rating
It became difficult to follow near the end despite watching all the videos and student curated notes.  I feel like I need more guidance during the actual assignments.  I do something wrong but am not sure where to reference to fix my code despite using internet resources.  It would be nice if there were "hints" along the way for ways to fix the code.
I enjoyed taking this course very much. The classes were well thought-out and laid a good foundation for understanding Python Data structures. While prior experience is helpful, I think the lectures were clear enough for even someone new to Python to grasp. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to build on the basic knowledge of Python.
Great course if you have prior coding experience then you should be able to complete this in 1-2 weeks although great it does have some issues like it rushes through the lessons quite fast and that results in things becoming confusing and resulting in you having to repeat videos to really understand the lesson otherwise still a great lesson 9/10
so i just started learning python and was pretty much a noob in programming skills but i loved taking the course working with the data sets thinking what more i can do further with a bigger data set . I'm more excited to learn how can i apply advanced mathematical concepts i'm learning at university to data and solve real life problems
Even though the course is on a slightly slower side, it's only to keep you learning at your own pace. Some may find the course to be to fast, some may find the course to be slower than expected, depending on your learning abilities. However, in the end it's what you learn that matters and not the pace at which you learnt those things.
I purchased the book and found the lectures complemented the drier text better.  Was able to easily reference the definitions of terms as well as see more of the materials in a bigger picture. Would like to see more graded exercises added to the requirements - for the basics of Python, think it's fundamental to continue practicing.
Its good, the instructor is awesome. But for the assignments to complete, you 'll have to take help of different sources to understand the basics because the assignments here are quietly advanced than what is being thought. Overall a 4 star. You can go with this course if you have the best of passion & hard work to indulge in it.
Good course, some of the material needs to be fixed, some of the lecture material has slight small errors in it where you will get some tracebacks if you are following along, but overall a very good program for DIY and a lot cheaper than some of the alternatives.  Charles is a great teacher and is very methodical in his approach.
Really a good course for beginners and if you are already familiar with the concepts, it will help you to recollect. One with coding background can complete the course in 2 or 3 weeks. The assignments given are fun as well as challenging. I'll definitely recommend this course for everyone, be it a beginner or an intermediate!
Wished it gave a more in-depth example for the tuples assignment as it felt like I was simply just using my knowledge from the previous 2 chapters and adding only a small portion of code dedicated to tuples. Nonetheless, I still learned about the different data structures available in Python as well as what sets them apart.
The course material and instructor are great. But some of the graders/TAs are not very helpful and often condescending. This is coming from a student who completed the first 2 courses in less than 3 days, so I did not ask many questions. Also, there needs to be office hours, where students can actually ask questions live.
Pretty decent class. Especially for those who is just beginning to learn Python. The only issue I had with this course is the on-line python compiler, which sometimes would erroneously interprets spacing and would randomly throw errors. Retyping and recompiling your code would solve the problem, but this is very annoying.
The lectures were good and to the point. I learned all the basics and the differences between data structures. The quizzes were quite good, with some nice traps set in them. The programming assignments supported the lectures well, though I felt there could've been more of them (perhaps just as ungraded bonus problems).
If you have taken Programming for everybody(Getting Started with Python)course then don't hesitate to take this one as well. Topics covered in this course are very crucial to become a good python programmer. One thing that this course is missing is object-oriented programming but overall I learned a lot of new things.
People with programming experience, start here. It will get you using python syntax and feature without completely boring you with information you already know.One drawback is that the homeworks were too simple. Optional challenge problems should be added into the course to make learning more effective and worthwhile.
Some things are a bit tough (for me personally) since i have ZERO programming background.But if you really dig in and try to absorb all the info that Mr Charles exlplains very clearly (eg for dummies) this course gives a lot.I really fell my brain changing to starting communicating with the computer.Thx guys a lot
The overall course was very good. It includes most of the topics like dictionaries,tuples and lists etc.and the best part of this course is they explained each of these in an interesting and powerful way.Thanks to coursera,I regained my knowledge in python but with better presentation and problem solving skills.
This course is slightly tougher than the previous one. Dr. Chuck explains the concepts really well. The quizzes and programming challenges in this course are tougher than the previous one, but the challenge makes it more fun. Overall great course to understand strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries in Python.
Overall solid, but it seems like the assignments at the end of the chapter are based around building one block of code with previous chapters elements tied in. While this is great, I wish there was more assignments at the end of the chapter that also solely focused on the new material and understanding it more.
from my perspective I think this is is the cursory and first layer of understanding the python data structure we still need more for deep understanding and practicing

but the best that I can see in that course the way of practicing every single word that your learned which is help you to memorize everything.
Good course.clear the all concept of data structure of python.it is very important to learn data structure because without data structure you cannot complete basic of that language.thanks sir for useful course and resource material. thanks our collage rajarambapu institute of technology for these courses.
The course is great to quickly understand the basic data structures in Python.I gave a 4 Stars because I think that it should have more programming exercises or assignments for each week. Interleaving videos with some practice would be also great.Other than that, its a great course for Python beginners!
The instructor was very lively and interactive throughout the whole course but I personally feel like they were a few important topics that weren't explained in the videos, though they were mentioned in the book. Other than this small drawback, I enjoyed learning the course even if it was online!
I learned how efficient you can solve problems and when to use certain data structures that were a bit confusing to name a few (Dictionaries and tuples) when to use each one is quite confusing I've been using lists for years and didn't know the difference between them. Thank you for this course.
This is a second course in the Python for Everybody Specialization. I really love the manner in which the continuation of the content is maintained. Also, the lectures are detailed with a good explanation of the code snippets. Kudos to Dr. Chuck for keeping all the course content open-sourced.
This course in Python for Everybody showed a different insight of python usage and it was good experience overall. However, i struggled alot in this course since there werent more videos for the lectures and it seemed as if the instructor was rushing the course as compare to the first course.
it was another great experience, and I learned a lot of new things which not only helped me underestand python but also helped me deeply underestand some of the programming concepts in other programming languages.I give four stars because some of the excersise were unneccessarly tricky.thanks
It's fun so and it's easy. I really love the way that Dr.Chuck teach the lessons, especially the magic part , lol. Hence, I highly recommended this course to people who never contact to coding. However, it's too easy to students who have learnt C++ /Java, but still, it's an excellent course.
“Good to be updated on the changes that have taken place. Top marks for the instructor.” “Overall the  is going to be very useful in my day to day job.” “Really well done; made a dry subject really interesting, and clearly has a passion for traffic management that shone through!

course
Good intro to data structures in Python. I started out with a semester's experience in Java at uni; it was not difficult to keep up. Also, Dr. Severance is a good teacher and explains things well. I recommend this course to beginners and people who have a little programming experience.
Great Instruction Videos, however more practice material would be helpful. Both coding exercise to play with as well as more emphasis on understanding the difference in executing the same functionality using different techniques. Granted, one can always play and tinker on their own.
The course content is very good in general as the instructor is very informative and not boring to listen to. However, it would be better if we can get more practice exercises along with solutions or hints to help us fully understand how to apply what we learned in different cases.
it was a good course, it does need some improvements and I think assignments should be more frequent, instead of one very large problem, assignments should perhaps be broken into 2 or 3 different parts. Also having only 1 exercise doesn't ensure full understanding of a subject.
I enjoyed this course and learned new concepts and methodologies that I currently use on a regular basis in my work to automate repetitive tasks.I would have liked to work towards a bigger project, instead of simple weekly assignments, but still a great course that I recommend.
very interesting course, good explanations even sometimes it seems that go a little bit off track. Probably more practice exercises in the middle of the lecture with the possibility of checking the solutions in an appendix would be benefitial in order to cement the concepts.
A little trickier than the first course and in some cases the explanations weren't as intuitive as in the first course, but overall, this is a great course for Python beginners with no computer science background. I love Dr. Chuck's teaching style; he makes it easy to "get."
it's great .It's awesome to finish another course .This course taught  many more things related to python .i look forward to enroll many more courses and get specialized in this topic .Finishing a course and getting certified adds zest to my confidence to learn new things .
This course of data structures have build-ed up my confidence in coding. and it feels good to gain data structures knowledge from zero upto now. Prof. Dr chuck are too good for the overall couse they taught everything very nicely and fluently. Thank You Coursera for this
4 and a half stars actually, what they teach is pretty much not detailed but how they teach is awesome. You can grasp it all easily and rest of all you can practice using the contents they provide. Truly amazed by the amount of material covered in the span of time : )
Thank you ! Great course, just the right pace (very important)Only (very (very)) small suggestion : stress on the links between list, dictionary and tuple ! How can you get from one to the other, especially with .item() it was by far the most difficult part so far :)
Good course.  Occasionally frustrating trying to learn to do the assignments without all of necessary support but if you are dedicated you will get through and learn the material too.  Course overall is a very manageable pace even if you have no experience like me.
The assignments are too easy in my opinion and don't require some thinking, but just some pure copy/pasting or repeating of already seen examples. I think that's something that could be improved because the content of the class and the lectures are actually great.
this course is good for learning but i think that there must be more questions to practice in this like first question is of easy level second is of medium level and third question is of hard level so that students can learn more deeply and can improve themselves
Well, to be honest i didn't find it that interesting than i found the part 1 of this course. Maybe because i felt it was a bit rushing on the topic and maybe more explanations abt the different exercises that could have been covered. Overall it was pretty good.
This course creates a solid bridge between the basics you learned and the advanced concepts you're going to learn in Python. Even if you have prior python experience, this course will be good refresher of your knowledge on Python. Thanks Dr.Chuck and Coursera.
I have just finished it and the instructor delivered this course so well. The presentation of thoughts are simple and easy to understand. This course is highly recommended. Content is great. Some thing is missing but the instructor illustrated so beautifully.
Excellent course and teaching. Clear and well-explained. It would be better if the course include more real-life exercises or challenges. I'm a beginner and this is only the second Python course I took (the first one is  the course 1 in this specialisation.)
I am thoroughly enjoying the programming for everybody specialization. In two months, I have gone from knowing absolutely nothing about programming (in any language) to being able to write a program that actually does stuff. Who knew it could be this easy?
Great course. Dr. Chuck is amazingly good. The reason behind taking off one star, is less number of exercises/Assignments. If there are 2-3 more assignments at least in the Lists and Dictionaries part it would become and excellent course for beginners.
Instructor is great. 4 star is because I expected to learn more. The first course contains more items to learn. Here I expected to learn about Libraries. The exercises is as simple as the first course. I recommend it to take if you have enough time.
Really great course.  I wish live office hours were available with the TAs, but if you dig into the e-book, all the necessary lessons are there to finish the assignments.  Some of the coding homework is tricky, but very rewarding once complete.
It was an awesome course with a lot of new concepts to learn. I feel, the chapters on Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples should have at least 5-6 graded assignments each, to make these concepts more clear through extensive programming assignments.
Course is a great intro to data structures using python. The faculty is great. Content is explained in a good way and class doesn't become boring. I would've given 5 stars if the bar of the quiz is raised a bit. At present its really easy.
The instructor, the videos, the quizzes and the assignments are perfect. Although, maybe due to many enrolled students, the teaching assistants are not very helpful and if you're stuck, maybe you'll have to take help from somewhere else.
Every topic was taught and explained well and the bonus materials were filled with fun and motivation for further learning. If the number of problem questions would be increased then the course will help to brush up the lessons learnt.
I feel very happy to learn this course. already, i know some of the content in the python but this course makes me a better than what i learnt in my college.thanks to coursera team for providing this course and for machigan university.
Kind of easy. Was expecting more in-depth introduction on the underlying mechanisms of each data type, why and when should we choose one data type to use over the other, and more analysis on the efficiency of using specific data types.
I generally like the edutainment approach of the professor. I feel like it could be even better to have more but shorter lecture parts with more programming assignments in between to better internalise what was shown in the video.
Very good course to understand how to read and interpret Python code. As far as allowing you the confidence to write code yourself, you will have to practice a lot on your own for the course does go rather fast through examples.
Ok this is harder than the first course. Then again I am here not just to learn and do well, but for the challenge.The way the learning content, and assessments are present is so much better laid out that what my company does.
The topic covered in Dictionaries and tuples were very good. The concept of "get" method and "List Comprehension" fascinates me to this subject and the instructor explains these concept very efficient manner with apt examples!
The teacher is motivating and keeps the learning funny, the extra video are cool and give you a broad view of how big the IT world is. The assignments are challenging and instructive. As a beginner I really enjoyed the course.
The course is extremely well developed and the content is explained well. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because when it goes the the files unit, I wish professor severance explained a bit more about terminal/command line.
the course is really helpful for the all-over technology geeks.is really helps to launch a new career and have some more advantage than other candidates to get the job thank s for the course and outstanding tutor Mr Charles
The first two courses are pretty basic. If someone really wants a more challenging and thorough learning of python than I would recommend the Rice University courses Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python 1,2.
This is the second course of Python for Everybody specialization. The material of this course is useful,but I think the assignments are kinda of easy. Anyway, I will continue this specialization,cuz Dr.Chuck is so cool!
The video lecture following the assignment is totally unrelated, that could have improved a lot and it seems like the video lectures were shoot in 2013 and since then there is no modification has been made in the course
This was a good course, the lecturer is excellent.My only complaint was that the quizzes and assignments were not challenging enough. There should be some more difficult assignments and problems included in this course.
The format is very nice, but the time it spends of concepts can be a little lopsided and it sometimes moves too fast through material (i.e. it teaches the material well, but barely tests your ability to implement it).
Course is pretty good and goes on in a perfect pace. Only problem I faced was while doing assignments. It little bit too advance than what we study through the lecture. But overall its a really nice course. Loved it.
Tuples topic was done quite swiftly, which made it hard to cope up. Perhaps one more video could have been added for tuples. Overall the curriculum was rushed up in the second course as compared to the first course.
I really enjoyed the course ,the way Mr Chuck sir explained is awesome.I know somewhat about this topics so I could manage and I complete the course fast.Thanks to University of Michigan ,helping a lot for students.
Excellent course - clear explanations, usefull examples.
2 things I think are needed:
More exercise - to help things sink in.
Exercises should include some digging into the python tutorial (e.g. use of more methods)
It's a great course for beginners.who are searching for some basic knowledge in programming. As python is one of the easiest programming languages so it's recommended to go through this course if you are a beginner
Provide me a good intro understanding of python data structures. This course can be designed better if instructor may cover some more data structures like linked lists, binary trees, etc. in Python. Thank you.
at sometimes i felt assignments were a bit simpler but course was faster and his explanation was very good and puts it in a simpler fashion.......thanks to him i got a good command over files and dictionaries
I enjoy how Charles has broken up the Python lectures in to bite sized pieces. It makes learning a lot easier to schedule. I've even taken other Python courses at the same time to taylor my educational needs.
much more difficult than the first part, the autograder did not work a few times for me which caused me to spend much more times that I should have but overall very good course and the teacher explains well
Hmm. Finally I learned a complete python things via coursera, and the instructor Dr. Charles is really cool to teach. I'm really happy now, and I'm do some programming stuffs using python to rock and roll.
Excellent course for the beginner. The course could have been a bit more complex in the problems for dictionaries and lists, but then again that would have made it longer and not suitable for the majority.
I know Python but wanted to refresh and brush up my basics. I have not gone through the video lectures and doing the exercises directly. I found the exercises very well built. Good for learning the basics.
Really great experience on coursera...made us good at data structures...showed their importance being very powerful tool in in puthon..hopefully will do more courses...instructor really deserves applaud..
the course was really amazing and I got to know so many new things about this python and that makes me feel more confident in my class and I am looking forward to learning more and more through Coursera.
Good overview of the different types of data structures.The assignments were fun and the autograder is really cool! Maybe a bit more assignment work just to make sure that everything is fully understood.
The courses are excellent, but I really wish there were more, and more in depth assignments. The amount of assignments does not really allow students to absorb course content without additional practice.
This is such a nice course to learn the very basics of python. Dr. Chuck is really interesting, a good motivator and an interactive mentor. He takes us through the entire course without making us bored.
help to get the basis skills of processing files, but there are feedbacks. For example, it was not possible to use split(':'), that's why I needed to write additional line of code to solve the problem.
i have learned what exact python is  now on this stage i can program in python and i recommend everyone want to study about the python to take this course and experienced and really thanks to Dr. CHUCK
Loved this course as it teaches you to get started with python and Dr.Chuck has made this course very much engaging and interesting. I would suggest to take this course in the order of specialization.
I really liked the course. I just wish it was more practice heavy and the lectures were broken up more and there were quizzes during the lectures to keep you engaged more and make it more interactive.
Very good course. However some data is served in too large chunks so it is hard to remember the stuff from videos without making a notes. I would recommend to write a code along when watching videos.
It could review the use of tuples/lists on variables like the settings variables on Django. Also, it could review more complex operations over the mentioned structures, like the list insert() method.
Very well done course, instructor/instruction was good and the contents (materials, quizzes, assignments) were of good quality.  I recommend if you are beginning your journey into Python, as I am.
Very informative class. Some of the hard topics in the last 2 chapters are not explained in a way that matched with the code terminology but good examples were given to help figure it out further.
Great course! Very succinctly presented. The course material and content is very well put together too. Just put in more coding assignments for each week and I will definitely rate this a 5 star!
I was happy with the first python course.this second course made me quite nervous about learning programming.But anyways I enjoyed learning new concepts and i will try to learn much more quicker
Starting to write program, this is way In. Can learn everything that is involved. Dr. Chuck is a good teacher, mostly he concentrated in building logic rather teaching syntax. I love his style.
The course has sufficient difficulty for learners to combine knowledge from different chapters together, and at the same time gives beginners like myself the confidence to continue programming.
Things are really starting to get interesting. Videos are generally very helpful. I had a tough time with the lecture on tuples. That one may require some fine tuning (or maybe I require some).
This is my 2nd course in Python For Everybody Specialization.It was good course for Python Data Structures and Assignments and quizzes are helpful. Bonus Material also valuable in this course.
The course is now becoming harder for me but the instructor Professor Chuck has arranged thing in very orderly manner so the learners like me are also learning the course with much enthusiasm.
I enjoy this course. This is really interesting course with pretty good stuff & assignments the instructor is also maintain the intraction to give some good knowledge with a serious funThanks!
More challenging problems would have been appreciated. I understand that there was a book and other additional materials to refer to, but additional problems built-in would have been better
Extra Nice, but I am not still feeling the power of Python over other Programming Languages, I guess I still have to study a bit more to get to know what is fascinating about this language
I have gotten what I needed from these classes. They where intended for someone with less programming background than myself so I occasionally found them tedious. That is on me, well done.
This course covers python data structure very efficiently. The course mainly focuses on most commonly used features. Examples used in lectures as well as the exercises are very practical.
Very well formed and easily understandable. Assignments are designed to revise all parts of concepts as we want. But in the last week (6th) better use of tuple could have been asked for.
Python နဲ့ Data structure ကိုလေ့လာရာမှာနားလည်ရလွယ်ကူပြီး၊ရိုးရှင်းတဲ့ course တစ်ခုပ့။This is a good course for studying data structure with python. This is simple and easy to understand.
Hi All,I liked the content , Instructor and the explanation is good which helps to understand concepts in a better way.The Assignments are also brainstorming for me. Need to learn more.
Great course, the lectures are comprehensive and easy to follow. The only recommendation which I have is to offer more optional assignments for those who would like some extra practise
The real advantage of using tuples to solve a problem was not terribly clear. Lists and dictionaries could solve all problems. Some features are useful though like multiple assignment.
It was really a nice experience for me. I have never put my hands on coding before. This course on python has boosted my confidence and has given me a zeal to explore python language.
Excellent course , I learned a lot of basic thing of python which I believe really enhance my programming capability  and  established a strong grounding of data structure of Python .
Absolutely great compilation of data structures and hits the brief. For a person who has somewhat a decent idea can easily complete this course in two days. Its a good brush through.
This course was insightful and easy to follow! This course would be more beneficial if there were more example problems and step-by-step solutions to the example problems. Thank you.
Great way of learning how Python works as well as what you can do with Python, and it's all relevant I really enjoy the tutoring style and the bonus interviews are really informative
The book was very helpful to get through this material.  I'd love to have some optional practice exercises, I've been coming up with things on my own but they're all pretty limited.
some of the exercises were earlier than they should have been as the course applicable for that exercise came in the next lecture so to have them together will be a much better help
Nice and easy to follow primer in Python data structures. You won't be learning any advanced programming techniques, but basic programming patterns applied to Python pass the revue.
There were some wrongs in code and some times I feel rush in video. Like, when teaching how to open file, didn't show any solution for those who are facing problem in opening file.
I think the course was phenomenal, challenging and great way to learn Python-Data structures.Thank you Dr. Chuck for teaching  this course and making it available for us to learn.
It is an excellent course but it would be nice  if he talk about complexity of these data structures. Over all this course is nice for complete beginner in the word of programming
Simple and clear. Quite satisfied with the fact that I finally understood the difference between tuples and lists. Could have been interesting to have sets in the course as well!
I knew almost nothing about programming just a month ago. Now I have done two of the courses of the specialization and I can actually understand other basic codes. Great course!
A practical course that transforms web based data extraction using efficient coding without the need to reinvent the wheel. A good mix of hands-on without getting too technical.
Good structure of this course. I did this course and was reading Python for informatics  book together. Gave me good platform to start doing more advance things to do in Python.
This course was pretty astonishing. I had no idea that taking a class  could be enjoyable and something I looked forward to. I definitely think that you should take this course.
excellent course and dr.chuck was amazing. the assignments were a bit easy and i would have liked them more difficult and there should have been more assignments for practice .
It's kinda easy course. It's good for beginner. I would recommend this course because the prof give lectures interesting and logical, so that I can follow up the class at ease.
interesting lecture, professor is trying to make python fun to starter. the outline is quite reasonable. however maybe the process is little slow for one who already has base.
This course give basic data structures that all new Python programmer need.From this course you will learn and try yourself about useful data structure that usually use later.
Overall satisfied with the course, moreover at the end of every chapter. There are extra videos about jquery, json, That was awesome. I learned something new in this course.
Great introduction!  I'm a grizzled IT veteran and this is only an ancillary part of my career, but it's something I've found very fun and interesting late in my career.
the course is good but i think one thing can make it prefect for beginners which is more practical exercises to make the student feel confident moving to the next lesson
Awesome course. Would be nice if the textbook was better integrated with the lectures and assignments though. The textbook often went way ahead of the week's objectives.
As for me, I would like to have at least two mandatory assignments in each section. It will provide more practical experience in processing of the material! Thank you!!!
Was a very good course. It was fun, though this could be included in first course as it was super-easy.But overall, course is fantastic, dr.Chuck is best instructor !!!
I took this course as part of the specialization, and I am
glad I did. Great course, I hope It will help me in the near future, when I
feel comfortable changing career.
Really good course, It helped me clear my basics within a short period of time. Also, the exercises are brilliantly planned to get useful understanding of the concept.
A mentor is what makes a hard thing to learn an easy one, and Dr. Chuck does that swinging his snape wand so easily. Will look forward to other courses with Dr. Chuck.
pinpoints main python challenges about data parsing, and provides clever practice exercises (I understand now why and when using a tuple, dict or list).Good mindset...
Worked exercises could have questions rewritten on top rather than just giving references to the question earlier. This would help in connecting rather than guessing.
This course has a very unique way of teaching Data Structures in Python where you actually get to work upon problems related to files and extracting data out of them.
Lovely course. Dr. Chuck always keeps things interesting. Had lots of fun while programming. Definitely one of the best MOOC Courses. Really good stuff for beginners.
The course keeps you certainly motivated despite the difficulties that arises in assignments. It is I think a lot to do with the instructor's passion and playfulness.
sometimes spent too much time assignments due to getting stuck and having no idea what to do next. as a result, a lot of time wasted uselessly, that could be avoided.
a very good course, the instructor is funny and very straight forward.the only thing that need to be improved is the assignments, they need to be more challenging ^_^
This course is way more better than previous course the auto grader assignment where good and challenging.And it was fun for me to solve those assignment. Thank you
It was a very awesome course it gave real class based course like experience , instructor Dr. Chuck is indeed very good.Thanks Coursera for providing me this course
Excellent python course, I would say it is best because it is right from the starch. That helped me a lot and time allocated to practice the learnings is awesome.
The graded tool assignments were a bit difficult as some of them included concepts which weren't taught before. Apart from that, a great course. Thank you, Chuck!
Python is an object oriented language. I would of like to have seen a little more of an expansion on creating classes and structure to importing my own libraries.
Great course, as was the first; would have liked a bit more detail on what is a function and what is a method for file handling. Otherwise, perfect, very helpful
It was pretty much organized course of python data structure. I have learnt all the things with very much courage and didn't get bored for a single time at all.
this course really was very interesting and i learn very new things in this course and it was fun to deal with problems on the concepts i learnt in this course.
It would be very helpful if they could include more worked out example since it'll help with grasping concepts much better.Apart from that wonderful experience!
First of all, I am very glad to pass this course. Hope it would be very useful in my career. I,m thankful to my Professor who made it easy to understand. Thanx
Great detail and highly informative, literally the sole detractor for me is that the videos can be somewhat circuitous when I'm anxious to learn the next part.
Great course. Could do with going over things a bit more deeply at times. There is a lot to take in for one course but still very good. I enjoyed it immensely.
This class is tough and time flies. No more intro stuff. This is is where we really start to get into some heavy programming (at least for my endurance level)
Its   nice experience for me to learn python.It helped me to build strong foundation.At the end i am happy with my learning.tank you for offering this course
It would be better if you include some other details like how to use stacks,queues,arrays,Binary_Trees,..... other real-time data structures in this course.
I think a little bit of more assignments would have helped loads. Still a very good course, a place where I really found myself growing in programming world
the course was helpful and the teacher was greati learned a lot of things, but the assignment had some problem sometime it don't  update the grade on system
I think this course is better than the first one. It's not as slow or as 'baby sitting.' it's very clear and easy to understand. And it sure is playful! :)
maybe could be more in depth. I really appreciated how passionate Dr Chuck is and how much he cares about his students even in online lectures. Thank you!!
Good content with a nice bit of character and playfulness from the professor. Be prepared to find your own ways to practice and solidify the skill, though.
It's a bit challenging for a arts student like me, but luckily I've passed the test.However, I believe it is better to take a back look from time to time.
Not bad for an introductory course, but I was hoping that they would cover more topics, and in greater depth. But Dr. Chuck's style is very approachable.
This course is just fabulous. It made me learn new things and just made me understand better by hands-on practice. This course taught me a lot. Thank you
Amazing way to teach, but the assignment problem are actually make me understand the topic at the best.Thanks for such assignment and help in the video.
An interesting course that is very well and clearly presented. The assignments are well designed to ensure that we understand the concepts and framework
The course is perfect for new learner . This course gave me something new in python data structure and now i  am able to do code with list, tuples etc
Awesome course. enjoyed proramming while doing assingments . Dr charles taught it in simpler way that helped to grasp the concepts in data structures.
The concepts were relatively tougher but the Dr. Chuck is an amazing teacher. May be there could have been additional videos with a few more examples.
Good course overall but week 2 is a repeat of week 2 in the first course of the specialization and I couldn't find a good way to skip it in Coursera.
Good course on Python Data Structures.Easy to follow and grasp the concepts.I would have liked it more, if it had more challenging graded assignments
it wasn't easy and took me longer than I initially anticipated, but well worth taking it a bit slower and getting these Data Structure fundamentals.
It is more about how to program in python instead of a Data Structure course~ But it is still very organized and you can really learn a lot from it!
Very good introductory course. pros: Very easy to follow. supportive community. amazing bonus material, eye-opening.cons: lacking in-depth exercise
This course is useful for very beginners and covers only basics of Data Structures. This course helped me as a quick review guide for my projects.
Its excellent course for anyone who is willing to learn python. Hats offs to Dr. Severance for the way he teaches. Its pleasure to learn from him.
could have given more idea on files writing files accessing it from desktop....i needed to surf the web to find that out...everything else was gr8
The course is very easy to learn and understand the data structures in python and can use efficiently when we faced the problem solving questions
Very good course.  Hope there is a summary of (1) operations of List, Dictionary and Tuple and (2) conversion between List, Dictionary and Tuple.
Its a good course for beginners who dont have any idea about programming. My suggestion is to practice a lot of problems while doing the course.
Learned a lot about python data structures and content on these topics are good and getting to learn more and more. I am trying to study more .
I got understand python data structure through this course. and I convince that information learned from this course will be helpful to my work
Very good course. You can be sure not to get lost here as long as you pay attention and do the work. You can't fail here if you apply yourself.
I have enjoyed a lot while I was learning my topics through Coursera. It's really amazing virtual learning platform with talented instructors.
Escellent content and presentation of material.  Disappointed that auditing course is not supported by grading of exercises, tests and quizes.
Somethings were not completely explained. But in a way it was good, as then I had to search on Google and learn them. Overall, a great course.
Dr. Chuck is very very good at what he is doing ,he has humor and helped a lot to understand all things about this course!Thank you very much.
Dr Charles way of teaching python is pretty different and very cool.Specially the bonus videos are great.The course is great and interesting.
A good course but simultaneous practice by learner is important to get a grip on the course as it doesn't include a lot of practice examples.
Very clear instructions from Chuck, nice assignments that are just a bit more difficult than you expect. Looking forward to the next episodes
Good job explaining, quizzes were helpful. Need a little more practice it felt like. Good job though, learned a lot about how to manage data.
I really enjoyed this course. However, I do wish they provided more exercises and practice problems. The textbook was very helpful, as well.
could use even more assignments!  Also, the TA's suggesting we use things that haven't been covered extensively isn't very helpful sometimes
Excellent course of python data structure .By taking this course our dictionary,list and amny other thing in python bulid at a great extent
I wish they provided more assignments at greater levels of difficulty, but overall the class is well taught and the concepts well explained
All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4  on the horizon
very cool professor, neat and clear instructions and exercises. might have been better with more detailed assignments even a final project.
This is a woneful course to learn from Expert teachers. This will serve a stepping stone into Machine learning or data science thru Python
All the course is good, the online playground may  need to be upgraded so that we can see the invisible tab and space to code efficiently.
Dr. Severance has an excellent way  exeplaining  and simplifing issues, truely it was interesting time in learning Python Data Structure,
This course provided the fundamentals for the data structures using python.  however, i wish the assignments were a bit more challenging.
The basic data structures have been introduced well without going into difficult constructs which helps learners grasp the concepts fast
The concepts were explained very beautifully.I found it a bit tough to grasp tuples concept. But it has made me working with python easy
The Coursera and this course both helped me with my dreams. The course was way better than I thought and classes were extremely lively.
It will be better if there is Chinese under the teacher. As a Chinese student, it is not that easy when I learn this course in English.
When came there the Python starts to become counter-intuitive. I need to talk to some senior programmers to get these assignments done.
Dr.Chuck you are the best python teacher i have ever learned from!Thank you for your support and i am excited to do course 3 of python.
Perhaps assignments were a little to straightforward - I would have enjoyed a more challenging final one. Very well presented and paced
A very good introduction to the basics of data structures in python. The assignment programs are very useful to understand the basics.
The course was very informative and easy to grasp. Concepts were explained In a simple to understand fashion and I enjoyed the class.
all was good explanation to assingment  try assingments first by yourself and then go to the worked examples for better understanding
Explain of each topic is very well. but teach some advance level exercise question.simply increase difficulty in passing this course.
Great course for the beginner & intermediate level. Very structured & interactive. The mentors at discussion forums are very helpful.
i always wanted to learn with Prof.Chuck and it was great experience .... i hope all are doing good .... all the best to everyone :)
Course material and problems were great, it would be more beneficial for students if there would be more different types assignments
It was very engaging. That makes it more understand. I am so glad to participate in this course. Can't wait to take my next course.
This course deserves 5 stars but their autograder sucks it has a very bad user interface I recommend them to use jupyter notebook.
This course has taught me a lot. Dr Chuck knows how to teach in the easiest way. He teaches in a way we converse with the computer
Good course, fun to learn. If you know programming and just want to know how to use python, you can complete this course in a day.
i like the way instructor tells us regarding the subject matters.Moreover the assignments anfd quiz helps us in gaining knowledge
The course involves major concepts of data structures in Python which is quite effective and useful for all the python aspirants
Again a great course to understand the basics of Python Data Structures. Loved the way professor demonstrated the use of Tuples.
it was a very powerful course and very skilled instructor i kinda enjoyed it and I'm very happy to take that course in coursera
This is a nice introductional course .  I was not happy with the excersises . Too simple, practically repetition of the lecture
very well taught of the concepts broken down as chapters and put together to understand and think the logic behind programming.
It was a great course but i found things getting a little tougher and got stuck also,but still there is scope for improvement.
pretty basicwould be  better if it covers assignments with stronger problems which leads to explore ore about data structures.
Mr chuck explains every basic concept of the particular topic which is the only thing that a student needs.Thanks to coursera.
Good and fund. Some new concept such as list, dictionary, etc, may be better explained for ones not very familiar with these.
This is a great course. Dr. Chuck is very nice person, I really like his attitude, the way how he approach solving problems.
It was really nice learning these things. The professor is really cool and explains the stuff perfectly. Thank you coursera.
The natural progression to the previous course. Things start getting a bit more sophisticated, so you have to keep focused.
This course is a very soft and gentle introduction to python data structures , really designed to real dummies. I liked it!
it was a bit like introduction to data structures in python...it cannot guarantee you mastery of ds but it is a good start
not something new to learn .i already knew 99% of the stuff.but still the content is good for those who are new to python.
nice n wonderful course to start with!!very useful,understandable,n easy for beginneres to cherish their coding language
its a very good course it goes from the basics to advanced level and the way prof:Charles Russell tells is a bit amazing
It's a great course. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is because I feel there should be more graded assignments.
Well paced, well explained. A bit of issues with the grader tbh; it appeared I had proper syntax but was getting errors.
The assignments could be made a little more harder as the basics course (previous one) was already completed before taki
An excellent course which will bring in a sense of confidence (to program in python) for all who diligently complete it.
Nice course for a starter, the pace is exponential.would be good, if an over course completion certificate is provided.
Great course, professor Chuck explains the subjects in an understandible manner. I only wish there were more exercises.
The course is very good. I have learned so many techniques and steps that I can use in my future coding and projects.
This course has a good structure but it is quite basic for someone who already knows some other programming language.
it was very interesting course i enjoyed along with learning and the problem excites to go ahead and ahead in course.
python Data Structures course is good and The Instructor Teaching method is interesting...Overall This course is Good
Everything was fine but you should keep the assignments a little bit simple rest everything was fine and appropriate.
As an introductory course its a perfect beginning with apt quiz and assignments which help you remember and practice.
It is good.But the videos are too long....maybe they can be split into parts,which would make them easier to complete
It was great learning more about Python. Thank you very much Dr. Chuck for making this so simple and understandable.
hii this course is very useful course for beginners in programmer, and to know how to type code with roles perfectly
Dear Lecturer,The only complaint is that I find this course pretty short, but everything is well made, and prepared.
I love this course. Moreover, there is increase in my python programming language slightly. Thanks a lot, coursera.
the course felt very brief, should have been more detailed and more kind of problems should also have been explored
Overall the course is good but at some points I thought that some more explanation would have been more benifecial.
Alert Box in Autograder annoys a lot,Other than that, everything's really great and awesome.Thank You Coursera. :-)
I think the string in-build functions used are very limited. If more functions added in course, it will more useful
Easy intro to basic structures in python. Some exposure on advanced structures such as Counters would be useful too
Good course for beginners. Not enough depth for people who want to master python and do some real projects with it.
Nice content but misplaced arrangement of topics in the sequence. Tuples should be prior to Lists and Dictionaries
This was a really good and interesting course. Can be taken to a bit higher level though to make it even more fun.
When Charles Severance is by your side. You cannot help but learn what he is teaching. Pitch-Perfect explanations.
It is a good introduction for new beginners, interesting and funny. However, not recommended to someone with bases
The exercises were interesting and seems more real-world rather than the exercises you may find on some textbooks!
The Instructor, how he teach, videos, and all of this course is great. i understand  all materials of this course
Good course. Things begin to get a little more complex. I recommend doing extra practice to help remember syntax.
Great course. Some small errors can add time to understanding. It's getting old (Python 2 vs. today's Python  3).
Nice course with comprehensive lectures, maybe a bit too easy but I learned a few things, so thank you very much!
Very good but more excercises need to be there from easy to hard levels to provide more expertise in the course.
Very good BASIC course to get familiar with python data structures.Teaching slides and video clear and pleasant.
its a bit tough course as every data structure has been related to files where not every time we use the files.
Like the first cours, this second was clair and really amazing, thanks for all of you specially the instructor.
Overall a great and interactive course!Great work! Dr. Charles SeverenceI will be returning for the 3rd course!
Very useful and understandable....Looking forward for more assignments on the topics to enhance understanding .
It covers the basic python data structures and it has added importance to my career in the form of certificate
Sometimes the course doesn't show the complicated example of the assignment. I cannot work them out sometimes.
Great second instalment of the Python For Everyone course. Concepts are clearly explained and easy to follow.
This course went over the basics in a great way. If you know python, skip around and focus on any weak areas.
It was great experience learning with sir chuck.I am going apply my learning from this course to my education
The course teacher is amazing. Thank you for guiding all the way. The course structure was also ver helpful.
You may explain more methods and i guess there should be more solved as well as unsolved problems.THANK YOU.
All the practice problems are based on  "mbox-short.txt " file. Working on different files might be helpful.
I loved this course on Coursera. I got to learn a lot of new stuff in Python. A big thanks to Prof. Charles.
Excellent course. I would prefere to have more excercises in order to fix the concepts and terms in my mind.
OVERALL COURSE IS NICE. I ONLY FEEL THAT RECURSION AND STUFF is MISSING OR YOU CAN SAY NOT PROPERLY COVERED
Amazing course, amazing instructor, lot of fun elements, easy to understand material. Not much challenging.
The course moves a bit slow for the amount of content, but for a programming beginner that could be a plus.
Excellent course for beginners whom do not practiced Python before. Need more exercises to master concepts.
More useful than part 1 which was too basic for me; and started actually learning new things toward the end
Just like the first one, really nice layout of the course and good explanations throughout the course book.
I love the lucid way of explaining complex concepts, you get to memorize it quickly and it stays with you.
The video for assignment's solution  in week 6 is not related to the assignment. Please try to update that
the course material is pretty good especially for beginners. More homework problems would definitely help.
Really good course, I wish we could have more practical exercise but It is a really great way of learning!
The best teacher for python. This course built up the tempo without any rush and the pace was just right.
this course is good for beginners and thanks to Coursera for providing this kind of courses for learners.
Great course, esp. for beginners; however I'd recommend mentioning a few more details of data structures.
wish to have more assignments no matter they need to be graded or not, just simply want to practice more
Good course. Few explanation seems redundant for experienced coders. But may be necessary for beginners.
Great class.Would be nice if we had more assignments. I'm really excited about starting the next course!
Good explaining on data structures, however shallow for people who already have good programming skills.
It´s not a course to manage python, its just and introduction of the basis but is pretty well explained
Very practical and well paced detailed to understand the basics of how data can be stored and accessed.
Very helpful.  I know other proramming languages, and this was key to using Python in a meaningful way.
Thank you for giving such a really good and unique content with happy infrastructure by Dr. Chuck sir.
Can you give a review or summary video in each week so we can quickly go through what we did last week
More Scenario based problems for coding (i.e. more number of assignment) should be there for practice.
Good class. The lecturer is a bit "nutty", but that's also what makes this class fun and entertaining.
It was an amazing course covering all the basics of Python data structures with quiz and assignments!
Using data structures has become so much easier, the course content was great and easy to understand.
Overall course has value, as it provides knowledge and understanding to the building blocks of Python
great class, excellent content, good pace and projects. some of the projects are a little repetitive.
Explanation of concepts is very good and clear,i really enjoy this journey of the python programming
This course is very good for beginners. Through this course I gained knowledge on concepts of files.
Iam very happy to learn this course. Tutor is awesome. Definitely it's taking me to the next level.
i guess if you could try to mix little bit with java too so that we can learn those differences too
I enjoyed all the challenges in this course, thanks a lot for Coursera and for Michigan University.
Good course for basic students who do not have any knowledge into programming. Highly recommended.
It was an excellent course with smooth and appropriate pace of learning of Python data structures.
He teaches python very well, for someoe with no begginer experience. And you get a certificate. :)
This is a great course. My only concern is that some contents are reused from the previous course.
Its Good for understanding of basics. Just finish it. Its the beginning only. There is lot to do.
Im so glad to do this course. Its a nice course and i will suggest all of them to do this course.
Quite a good course as I was able to gain everything being taught .Enjoyed teaching by Dr.Chuck.
THIS COURSE HELPED ME IN LEARNING PYTHON AND THIS COURSE CLASSES ARE ALSO SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND.
I wish tuples were explained a little more or with more examples.Other than that, superb course!
The module overall was good, but for a beginner I found some concepts really hard to understand.
The course is very good but somewhere along the course I got lost. But I guess that's my fault.
One of the best course that I have learned more than I thought,good instructor and good course.
Very nice explanation. The course could have had more assignments and data structures in depth.
Have a little more advanced topics along with the basics or at least references or a direction
More assignments and a downloadable file of all the slides used in lectures would really help.
Very nice course to start from beginning for every student, who had interested in programming.
whole course was really good..!! But it would be even more good, if more functions are taught.
An excellent and pragmatic approach to learning the fundamental facets of python data analysis
*One of The BEST! course for Python.*Secondly,hats off to Dr. Chuck ;such a great instructor.
This is a good cousre for a beginner, and to clear the basics. And Charles  is a good teacher
Relatively simple. Again I enjoyed the bonus interviews: They were very helpful and inspiring
Great course. Helped me a lot in understanding the concepts of data structures using python.
Very helpful course again, thanks to Dr. Chuck for making it easy to follow and interesting!
this course is very helpful ,it helps me to increase my tendency to understand the concepts
Great course, nice explanation from the basic and exercises after the class is very helpful
This is excellent course on basic data structure. I will encourage you to take this course.
Great Content and exercises.Helped me to understand data structures in python very easily.
Good course for the data structures the core aspects are covered very well in this course.
Basics of Python Data Structures made very clear. Also material provided comes very handy.
Thank You Dr. Chuck for a great course for a good foundation on data structures in Python!
Very good intro into the data structure basics, but needed more material and assignments.
It's nice but assignments are bit complicated when compared to Programming for everybody.
Excellent course being provided by Coursera and thanx to Dr chuck the talented instructor
Excellent courses. It is very important to check the written content to do all exercises.
This course help me a lot in making basic right concept regarding python data structure.
in course Python Data structures It is helpful to learn the python list,dict and so on .
I got a little confusing in tuples and dictionaries please make it a little more simple.
Good entry-level course, i used it to refresh some basic python knowledge for 3rd course
Great course.It has really boosted my confidence to learn new things about programming.
This is a very good course and also useful for my carrier. Thank you so much, Mr. Chuck
I think the course needs to include talking about tuples as an important data structure
I was a great course, but I think It can be better by giving more hands-on assignments.
Excellent course to understand the basic data structures that exist in Python language.
easy to learn, and struggle enough to apply what i've learned into coding from scratch
learned a lot in this course,this course upgrade my thinking level as well adaptation.
Felt like it was bit fast paced which might not be easy to catch-up for many students
Thorough explanation, good pace for people that need time to take in the information.
It's very good course .The concept of basic python is  very clear after this course.
A go-to course for beginning Python. But this just the beginning with lots to learn.
I learn a lot about python data structure in a very simple way!! Thank you dr.chuck!
It was fun learning extention of what we started with strings,dictionaries and files
some more brief explanation in case of dictionary and tuples would be more helpful .
Enjoyed it: very clear. One star off because I feel we could have gone a bit deeper.
It's completely straightforward to learn and understand. Thanks for your enthusiasm.
Excellent method of teaching. Difficulty of assignments however should be increased
It was so good. I can able to understand conditions and statements of python easily
Very clear to understand. The explanation is straight forward and very interactive!
course is really good and the instructor explains all in simple and in easy manner
The Course is ok. But week 5,6. graded assignment is too much tough to understand.
A very good for beginners of python. good information about basic data structures.
Really appreciate Dr. Chuck's enthusiasm and clarity in explanations. Fun course !
i learn such an amazing skills in python programming and very interactive course.
course is good , but it will be more useful if you add chapters like OOP concepts
the problem statements were very helpful in developing a problem solving approach
The lectures seemed to be a little rushed, but it was overall a great experience.
Best Online course for Python which gives the theoretical and practical knowledge
Very very well explained even if in my opinion it lacks a bit of practice coding.
Fantastic lecturer who explains concepts and fundamentals of Python very clearly.
very interesting, but I can't find all the material and codes for more practise.
It would be better if contents of videos can stick to the textbook more closely.
Later courses including the capstone project do not seem very instructive to me.
great content, but a little short... would love to meed Dr. Chuck in person ! =)
Nice and small lectures which helps me to learn efficiently. Thank you Professor
Nice one, for complete beginners.But the assignments age just too easy, I think.
Optional practice problems / assignments should be given which are challenging.
it was great exprience with this course. i have studied under diligent teacher.
really helpful for the beginners to learn python and useful in their work need.
the last 3 weeks had a faster pace than expected, otherwise a great experience!
Good introduction to data structures in Python. Exercises are a bit repetitive.
Its easy and good .it will definitely help  for the beginners for programming.
well i like this course. it was very helpful for me to understand python lang.
this course is very usefull for us and i very exciting to learn another course
It is a very good course for those who want to learn Data Structure in Python.
A well organised course that does provide a good deal of information. Thanks!!
wow that's really great teaching style of your and thank you coursera for this
Very short course but quite elegant but obviously the content can be increased
Great job by Dr. Chuck. He was funny and very good with the examples.Loved it.
great introduction to python, good foundation to build on and great professor!
This class offers great information, but the lectures could be more efficient.
professional but more exercises are needed to be added to course for practice
It was a good experience for me. I think instructor is very good at teaching.
I think this course is very concise and fundamental. Very good for beginners!
Great course to step into data structures and building a stronmg foundation.
This course more intresting  and every topic are cleared to a basic concept.
Good practice, may need to be better organized though... Great course anyway
Average . Does not elaborate all the topics completely.Decent for beginners.
Really great course.....but expect problem sets to be little more difficult.
excellent videos and challenging assignments to get thorough with the topics
The teaching staff is supportive and Dr Chuk explains in a friendly manner.
very goon intro but any one enroll on it have to know that it is just intro
All in all I enjoyed it . Could use additional content on nested for loops.
programming exercises will help u learn how to use lists, dictionaries etc
Great teacher, just hard for a newbie like me to grasp everything quickly.
It will be great to also have more on  SET as part of the data structures.
With great mentor comes great learning ...interesting learning experience.
Very information course. Caters to both newbies and experienced programmer
The syllabus is too easy for a beginner also.Make it slightly challenging.
Thank you for opportunity, bu tcan you publish course for Python Advanced?
Informative, but overall very short. Wish there was a couple more chapters
Really great experience.Dr. Chuck is a great man and really good teacher.
I really like this course and I love the lectures of Professor Severance!
This course is easy to understand python guide was very much interactive.
the is very elementary level course i think it should be little advanced.
Great follow-up to the first course. Great pace for just learning Python.
Good fundamentals of data structures are taught in an understandable way.
I'd like assignments to be more complicated and I'd like more assignments
A well explanied concept and understood about Python and datas structure
It was a fun learning this course. This course is perfect for beginners.
The lecturer is truly nice. The content of the course is well-organized.
It was awesome learning with Dr.Chuck and it was a wonderful experience.
For a person new to coding it's a bit challenging. But it's all worth it
the course is good overall but assignments can be much more challenging
it is good course.i enjoy a lot to learn this.it is quite interesting.
It's very easy to learn for the beginners, and Dr. Chuck is awesome...
the teaching was amazing but the auto grader did give alot of trouble.
Nice class but something more hard and tough assignments are needed :(
Dr. Chuck is great as usual. And some probles with autograder service.
Very good source for learning lists, dictionaries and tuples in python
this course should be perfect and systematic way of studied in python
The assignments are very important part of the course. great learning
The tulips part seemed a bit teached in hurry, but else it's ok! thx!
with this course iam fully boosted with datastructure part.thank you.
Learnt more basic stuff in python .Explanations are clear and helpful
This course really helped me to grab overviews of the Python. Thanks!
The Grader Doesn't have test cases .Anyone can fool the grader easily
a bit boring than the first one but the instructor is very very good
This course was very interesting and I enjoyed it . Thank you sir !!
A good course for a beginner in continuation to Python for everybody
after doing this course i have learn more about programmin languages
A great course for some basic yet very commonly used data structures
This course is really awsome .The teaching techniques are also cool.
I could understand the object oriented language through this course.
Compared to the previous Course on Python, this was a bit difficult
Awesome teaching, more examples could be discussed for each concept
The Course Instructor was damn awesome! Made things simple to learn
its a nice startup course to learn python primitive data structures
Excellent, am becoming a more confident programmerLoved this course
it was very informative but the auto grader tool can be improvised
please stop making lame jokes. except that teacher is really great
Very pedagogical courses! Exercises get more and more difficult...
Very understanding for beginners and assignments are awesome!!!:))
the course is smooth for those with lesser programming experience.
Great course...good place for a beginner to start and learn PYTHON
I think we could have dove into actually analyzing some more data.
loved it the assignments were good in this except peer s checking
Very nice course for basics, but it should've had more exercises.
really informative and precise easy to understand..just loved it.
Great content, moves a little slow sometimes.  Dr Chuck is great.
great course but needs a little bit more videos for the exercises
Well Designed and simple explanation made the learning enjoyable.
Good for beginners. Would be nice if there were more assignments.
Could have been given more detailed and thorough study material.
helped me learned a lot...!!!.....nicely explained and presented
A decent course though not the amount of detail that I expected.

Charles is a great teacher who has the ability to explain concepts in  lucid and yet engaging talks.I recommend this course to anyone who has basic python knowledge and wants to learn Data Structures (lists,dictionaries,strings,tuples) in Python.
This was a super-fun course! The materials were very easy to follow, and delivered in a very friendly and engaging manner. I highly recommend this course to anyone just getting started in programming.
Dr. Chuck is awesome!  I audited this and the beginner class to prepare for a training course for work . I needed to prepare to learn an AV system control scripting software that uses a Python-based language. I tried some Code Academy lessons and some other short interactive tutorials but I just wasn't getting the deeper, meaningful learning experience that I was looking for. This truly feels like having access to a university course on the subject (if you continue with the other courses in this specialization after this). The lectures are great, I highly recommend also reading the textbook as well to get a deeper understanding, and doing the auto-grader assignments to verify your working knowledge is a great tool. The time and effort commitment for the first 2 courses has felt like a light load, a great way to get started if you're feeling overwhelmed about learning a scripting language. Thank you Dr. Chuck!!!!
I feel incredible that I knew almost nothing about programming just a month ago. Now I have done two of the courses of the specialization and I can actually understand other basic codes. Great course!
assignment 9.4 auto grader not working .LTI unable to launch.error message: This tool should be launched from a learning system using LTI.i am using chrome on mac book air 2  and python 3.6
This is the second course in the python for everybody specialization. I must say, it's been an interesting ride from course 1 to 2 and I intend to go all the way. The areas covered include: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries and they were touched upon as exhaustively as possible and Dr. Chuck was very impressive. The assignments were something to look up to, the videos very interesting (most especially the graduation ceremony)and straight forward but most of all, there is no unnecessary material in this course(stuffs like how the hash function works). However, I must warn prospective learners that the course builds upon course 1 of the specialization(though not much) and so I recommend this course to anyone who's done with course 1 and also anyone who understands the basic syntax of the python language
Great course for pyhton. Loved this course and enjoyed it. Thanks to Dr.Chuck. If anyone who want to take a course which is well explained and fun for python learning, then Hey!!! this is your course.
Yet another excellent course with Dr. Chuck.  Thank you!Key positives:  Dr. Chuck patiently covers the "pain-points" that are difficult for students to learn on their own but tend to be overlooked by codecademy.com and codeschool.com.  It's also nice to see him making occasional errors in the code because that humanizes the learning experience.  The biggest bonus, however, is his interviews with the "star programmers" / language developers.  These interviews make the student feel like he's already part of an "elite" albeit in a nascent cocoon phase.  Before I forget, I also think the videos of the international office hours are far more important than one would initially imagine in forging a sense of MOOC camaraderie that would otherwise be absent--being a MOOC student can be lonely experience.  The video snippets also serve to provide a moment of respite from the assignments.
Excellent course to take you through the basics of data structures, by the end I was confident in my ability to complete the assignments due to the similar / building nature of how the lessons / assignments start to stack on top of each other.
Excellent Way to learn Python.I am completely new to programming, but able to complete the course with in the time and now I am comfortable with the basics python programming.  Charles made it a simple thing. His way of teaching, taking it step by step is very nice. Assignments are simple and at the same time ensures that we are good to go to next chapter. Support for questions while doing assignments is great.Thanks to University of Michigan for allowing us completing assignments as well, without payment. This is very great. Giving chance to every one to complete assignments and in addition providing support during assignments is actually shows the social commitment of University that education should be available to every one .
A really great course that gave me a solid grounding for using Python to retrieve specific data.  It was basic enough for me--a first time programmer--to understand, yet challenging enough for me to actually get to the point of --Wow, I am actually really programming!
Python Data Structures is a great course for anyone who is interested in learning computer programming. The concepts taught here are very relevant to the field of Computer Science and apply to any programming language. The fact that this course uses Python for teaching programming is not a limitation, but rather a boon for students who may be intimidated by other programming languages. Python is easy and very fun to learn. It is also utilized by many large companies for things such as data analysis and modeling, so developing a fluency with Python is a valuable skill.Dr. Chuck speaks and teaches well, and he is very enthusiastic about the subject of Computer Science. My favorite thing about him is that he shows multiple examples during lectures. It also helps that he knows how to relax and have fun at times. I highly recommend him to any student!
I found the course and teaching method very comprehensible for a beginner (like me) and other interested students. I have learned quite much within a short time, though needed to persist and allocate learning time. I am beginning to fill confident in working my way around with python and using recommended tools (notepad++, python, snipping, using interactive python through cmd prompt), after series of writing, testing and correcting my codes prior to submitting my course assignments. In conclusion, I am feeling confident and will continue to build this confidence by taking upcoming courses. Thank you Dr Charles Severance for such inspiring and comprehensive lesson. I look forward to continuous learning in up-coming courses, and an opportunity to meet!
this class covered what i find to be very confusing topics. After this class i feel that i have a working knowledge of these topics. The class was challenging and the exercises were also challenging.
wonderful, not only do I learn python, but I learn about computers/IT in general in a fun way!
A very easy one. Perfect for beginners in Python learning.
I THANK YOU SIR FOR PROVIDING ME SUCH BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL.
Professor Severance makes learning Python easy and fun!
Amazing and really good for a novice
Wonderful experience! Dr. Chuck is the best professor I've met on the Coursera, he is really enthusiastic about teaching and made me enthusiastic about learning! I have learned python before, I originally just want to use this course as a review, but Dr. Chuck did teach me a lot. First of all, it's a perfect beginning level course for python, it gave me a solid review in a relatively short period of time, it also gave me more insight on python, other areas of computer science, even on the career. I have never seen a professor post like an officer hour, a tour, a meeting with other experts in computer science, and the most surprising and exciting one - Graduation Ceremony! I can't conceal my appreciation for Dr. Chuck, I'm hoping to meet him and talk with him someday in the future.
This course was an excellent experience for me. In my opinion, Dr. Chuck is a very creative and brilliant teacher. I think being a teacher is one of the most difficult professions in the world, but being a great online teacher is even more difficult. Nevertheless Dr Chuck has proved that this is possible. He makes that every student who takes his classes fall in love with Python, and want to learn everything about it. Also he gives us all the information and the tools we need to understand each leccion and to make all the excersices in the course. He invents different ways to motivate his students, such as all the interviews to famous IT people, and the meetings with fellow students of Coursera. I'm very greatfull for this experience, thanks to Coursera and thanks to Dr. Chuck.
Chuck is still a
great lecturer. It’s a pleasure to listen and watch him. I am lucky
for the chance.But, *some grunting*
if first course was Hogwarts-like, second was definitely  in
Azkaban-manner.It seems as Chuck
was kidnapped from his cozy study, devoid of his fave thermo-mug and
such like, he was placed in some dark something. So even Chuck became
not so happy self, imho. Some Azkaban-notes one can see in The Course
N2. Just look at the paper-glass in hands of the professor. 
Tuples-week seemed
to me was read in hasty manner. From 14:46 it was even that Prof was
a bit inaccurate, (chalked too much of stuff on the screen and one or
two other things).Week 7 showed us his
return to his Lares and Penates but the exception imho just proves
the rule.If one asks for my
personal opinion, I vote for “Hogwarts”, study-lectures without
cameramen tricks and with the thermo-mug. I hope future courses would
be great too. Chuck Rules!
Absolutely awesome course. Dr. Chuck has earned my first internship earning me around 150$ per month at the age of 18. I'm now a python trainer myself at a small organisation.
Excellent explanation. Professor Charles kept the course from being monotonous. Learnt in depth about reading from file, sorting dictionaries and appending lists. Looking forward to learn more courses
I just love Mr. Charles. I honestly appreciate the effort he put into making the graduation video. Truly encouraging students to learn more was really moving. Thanks so much for this course, Charles.
Dr. Chuck is the most encouraging and entertaining teacher I have ever met!!! He really makes learning about computer and programming easy and fun! I really enjoyed his lectures and I cannot believe learning programming can be such a pleasure! Most importantly, Dr. Chuck intentionally included many mistakes in his teaching materials. As a self-taught programmer who has struggled on one's own, I believe this is the most valuable part of the lectures. The students get to understand from the very beginning how to read error messages and tracebacks, how to debug, how not to be intimidated by mistakes and failures, and how to become a confident programmer. This should be THE teaching model for programming in any language!Thank you, Dr. Chuck! And I look forward to learning more from you in our follow-up courses!
I am very happy to have finished this course. I learned a lot from him. I did not like Python. I thought it was not interesting to learn this language, but I was wrong. Today I strongly recommend learning more this language because it can help you a lot with your simple way of solving things. Thanks to all of you who have made this course possible.
It was able understand the basics of data structures easily and work out the assignments.
This is the second course in the Python for Everybody specialization, and corresponds to the second half of the previous course of the same name. As with the first course (Getting Started with Python), I found Dr. Chuck's thorough approach to the material to be likely to be very approachable for a beginning programmer. I have some experience with Python, including the previous course and a course in the Genomic Data Science specialization, and I have a fair amount more experience programming using R, so I found this course very easy.The course introduces the common data structures in Python (lists, strings, files, dictionaries, tuples) and the functions used to manipulate them. Dr. Chuck does an excellent job of introducing each piece, although the course is a bit light on practice problems, and there are probably better resources for actually getting comfortable using these on a regular basis. The book "Learn Python the Hard Way" and the EdX course from MITx (6.00.1x) are supposed to be two of the best resources out there. I recently bought the first and enrolled in the second, so I'm hopeful that they will help me to become as comfortable programming in Python as I am in R.Overall, four stars. A gentle introduction to data structures in Python, but a little light on the exercises needed to become really proficient in using them.
Absolutely amazing course!! The instructor, Dr. Charles
Severance (popularly known as Dr. Chuck), is a very jolly and knowledgeable
instructor. Just like in the previous course Programming for Everybody (Getting
Started with Python), he has explained everything to the highest level of
detail, and his main aim is to make everyone understand what he teaches, even
someone who does not have a major computer/programming background. He has
prepared great examples which help you understand every line of code, and help
you apply them in your applications. Dr. Chuck insists upon you learning what
every small detail is, and why it exists, which I like very much being an
engineer, and everyone will like. The difficulty of the course is also very
appropriate, i.e., every assignment is not very basic and straightforward, but
not impossible, and is challenging and makes your brain work, a process in
which you learn how to apply your programming skills to different cases as per
requirement. Completing each exercise gives you great levels of satisfaction of
having achieved something, learned something new. So, overall this course is a
great pleasure to take and I am very much satisfied and very happy to have
taken the time to complete this course, it is worth it!! Thank You for
reading!! :) :D
I can compare this class to the Coursera class that I took from Rice University, fundamentals of computing. On the negative side, the problems offered in this class are pretty easy to solve with minimal effort. On the positive side, in my opinion, the class does not focus at all on games or making a game. While I like the idea of working on a larger project, the video game approach used by Rice University was not very useful for me. This class and the series will give you a pretty solid understanding and background with regards to very fundamental concepts in programming and computer science and it will be done in a way that is very easy to understand. I like the way that it builds on itself with regards to the complexity. Is it easy? Yes, it's pretty easy but Computer Science is a pretty tough subject and this is a great introduction. Charles Severance is an excellent lecturer and he gives a great deal of context and helped me to really understand some key concepts in Computer Science. As an engineer, this will help me a great deal in my job.
The single most important piece of information I can pass for potential learners of this course is this :Remember in high school/college/university when you had that one professor who, regardless of the topic he taught, was able to make you laugh, learn and keep you interested no matter what ?This is the caliber of Dr. Charles Severance. This person is just born to teach people and does it in an effortless manner. I have a scientific educational background and an engineer's degree, and he ranks among the very best teachers I've come across, even though I never met him which is somewhat ironic :)Regarding the course in itself, content is to the point,the pace is good, quizzes are very nice, assignments are well balanced in terms of difficulty and the worked exercices are very useful. I honestly don't think there is a better online source for learning Python Data Structures than this one.Right after writing this review, I'm going to look up another course by him and won't think twice about enrolling.Happy learning !
That programming course is just awesome for both the beginner and the intermediate learners. I think, it will be helpful for almost all types of learners. From that course the starting of the journey of programming is really good. There one can learn the upper basic and uses deeply of programming as well as the variables, operations, the statements, iterations, conditions, break-continue statements, loops, functions etc and specially i've learnt the data structures, different applications, problem solvings etc and the dictionary, tuples, lists are highly mentioned here. The professor here is awesome teachers and he teaches us such way to make more teachers or instructors. So, that course help me to learn the basic and it has increased the interest in me. I highly recommend to start programming, specially python programming. And start the journey of programming world. And I hope the next courses will be such helpfull. So, wish you a very happy programming.
I loved the way Dr. Charles Russell has teach me in this course  This course builds on the first course: ' Python for everybody' and covers chapters 6 - 10 of the open source book 'Python for Everybody' by Charles Severance. The course is open source as well and together with the ppt-presentation and video's guides you through the main applications of Python. The teaching approach is down-to earth, building on the already acquired knowledge from previous chapters. Each assignment uses a ' real-world' example and allows for trial and error, building on the learning-experience.That said, the instructor, Charles Severance, does a proper job in taking students through the course chapters in a light-hearted and optimistic manner. This course, as a non-native English speaking mature student with little experience in programming and IT, took me approximately 6 - 12 hours of study per week. I would advice this free course to everyone with an interest in Python.
i love this course, and as i keep progressing in python, these courses will be more and more useful and fun. the course offers assignments, which give yo clues on where to start, but not too much so that it would be easy. the teacher, Dr.chuck is very nice and is a fun and great teacher. there arent an overwhelming amount of videos a week, and if a person were to work hard, they could finish the course in almost a week(they would not learn much though...). the skulpt, or python playground is a very nicely designed platform for simple codes that are done in this course and the first, and the community and mentors are very helpful when it comes to having a hard problem in the assignment. overall, i give this course as many stars as i can! this is because since i am only a 11 year old in middle school, i can still understand and pass the course! thank you for having me in the course and i hope to succeed in later courses in the specialization! :)
This course is a breath of fresh air
before i didnt know any programming language , I didn't have any idea then I knew about this course. Coursera gave me this opportunity to avail this course for free in COVID 19 . I am greateful to them for giving me this opportunity . I am able to utilize my home quarentine days and make it productive by getting started learning python as my first programming language. I am greateful to my course instructor Mr. Chuck . I saw him as an amazing person who doesn't really act like a traditional teacher  or faculty member , He's style of teaching python is really interesting . Its a lifetime opportunity doing this course. It not just give you a set of instruction only , it knows how would you feel how would you become frustrated during learning period and then shows the way up too . I am feeling more interested learning more of python. After all Its just getting started and learning never ends
This is the second course in the python for everybody
specialization. I must say, it's been an interesting moment from course 1 to 2
and I intend to go all the way to next one. The areas covered include: Lists,
Tuples, Dictionaries and they were touched upon as exhaustively as possible and
Dr. Chuck lesson was very impressive. The assignments were something to be
serious with and look up to.  The videos were very interesting and straight forward but
most of all, there is no unnecessary material in this course(stuffs like how
the hash function works). However, I must warn prospective learners that the
course builds upon course 1 of the specialization they shouldn't quit at this
point. I therefore, recommend this course to anyone who's done with course 1 and
also anyone who understands the basic syntax of the python programming
language, to move a bit further.
This is a very good course and this is a very useful course for learning python. I completed the previous course in this specialization and found this course which was following and I found this course very useful and easy after completing the previous one. If I did not take my time in the previous course, I am sure that I would have gone crazy by looking at the first lecture of this course because this needs the basic understanding of python for progressing. In a short and overall manner, I loved this course and I would recommend all my friends to participate in this specialization and grow their knowledge. Thank You Dr. Charles Severance, my instructor, all the teaching staffs, University of Michigan and Coursera for making this great course available for people like me to learn new things. Thank you
This is one of the best course you can take if you want to learn programming for fun.
This course primarily focuses on programming and it will help you to introduce you with python data structures.
The exercises are beginner friendly and you will enjoy while solving them. Quizzes are also good and help to understand everything.
The main part of the course is an instructor. Believe me Dr. Chuck is the one of the best teacher you can ever learn from. Their way of  explaining complicated concepts in easy way is very good. Their explanation will simplify most of the things and soon python will be your favorite language.
I will not recommend this course if you are not new into python data structures. Also if you are student and want learn python along with logic, this course might disappoint you.
First of all, I would like to thank the instructor, Prof. Chuck! for such a wonderful course. It was nicely designed and all the concepts were well explained.  It would be great if Prof Chuck tries to include the following points (people like me with a scientific background would find it very helpful):I would like the instructor to explain that in what respect python is different from other languages. Particularly I'm interested in the scientific computing aspects of Python. What are the differences between a scripting language and a programming language? I've heard Python is not suitable for scientific programming as it is slow compared to Fortran or C. Is it true? If so why? Thanks in advance! Wish Prof Chuck all the best!
The class was really wonderful! Dr. Chuck does such a good job explaining the concepts, with slides and video mixed together, that you don't even have to watch the videos multiple times. (if you're paying attention and taking occasional notes) I would recommend the certificate track because it came in handy on a couple of occasions when I had questions. Speaking of, I'd like to throw a shout out to Tamara Brunnock, a member of the teaching staff, for routinely answering my silly questions in the forums. Without her help, I would not have been as successful in this class. The class showed me exactly how data is structured in python and what built in functions we can use to work with lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
Professor is great, and the course gives a thorough introduction to python data structures and isn't too hard to get. The only reason that I would give 4 stars is because the assignments and exercises. Each chapter you only get 1 or 2 codes to write, which can be easily adapted from the codes showed online. I'm hoping for variety of coding exercises to better understand the concepts. Since coding problems suitable for your stage is not easy to find out there on the internet. After completing this I can get a superficial understanding of the course materials, but right now it's still difficult for me to write a simple code using the knowledge covered in this lecture. You need to find your own source to practice.
I am really enjoying the way the Dr Chuck teaches this
class. Lots of thing he uses or mentions about are useful to other very
relevant areas as well. He always focuses on the key point of his chapters. I
am just a chemistry student, but I think Python program is more and more useful
in science research. The examples in Dr Chuck's course improves my ability to
ready codes light years of way. I also like his great sense of humor, which
makes me much relax in a difficult course. One of the best things about him is
that he will demonstrate why some of the codes do not work and how to debug
them. I definitely will recommend this course to my fellows and I really look
forward to completing the upcoming sections.
This course is a great introduction to Python. As a person with limited previous experience in MATLAB, I enjoyed this course even more than the previous one, Getting Started with Python. There were more new things to learn and I found watching the lectures at 1.25x to be the perfect pace. The assignments are concise and a nice bit of hands on learning without taking up much time. Dr. Chuck is pretty funny and makes you feel like you are totally capable of tackling Python. I only wish the grader was available on quizzes for people auditing the course - you can read them but you can't submit. Beggars can't be choosers, but I would happily click through some ads in order to do so! Overall: excellent course.
Python data structures is the second course of "python for everybody" and I learned more from this course. I think I get closer to Python after this course. Now I clearly know what string, file, list, dictionary and tuple are and know how to use them properly. Plus, at the end of this course, finally I have understood the case which was shown at the beginning of the course. It was an amazing experience that after your perseverance and  diligence of learning Python, you understand something you don't understand before. Last but not least, Dr. Chuck is a very excellent instructor and he can vividly show cases and important knowledge points. I'm very glad I can learn a lot from his online course.
It is a great course with an awesome lecturer! This course is great place to start learning about python.The lectures are short easy to understand and there are assignments to enchance your coding skills,you mgiht not get the code right the first time but by coding ,testing trail and error ,you will be able to code using python.You have access to some great programmers talking about computer languages in the bonus section and they can really inspirational if you are aspiring to be like them.You code even if you don't have desktop computer or laptop because they provide a program to let you code on the website to complete your assignments but they insist you download python and work with it.
Very engaging! If you're a coder in any other language, this and the previous course will be enough to get you useful in Python. Resist the temptation to breeze through it: you'll learn a lot more if you pay attention. I did.If you're completely new to programming, I recommend you look at the worked examples before tackling the programming assignment. That and a careful review of the lecture material will get you through. Also if you get anything less than 100% in the quiz, that's a clue that you might benefit from taking a break and then watching the lecture again before tackling the main assignment.The lecturer is engaging and makes the material accessible. I wish I taught so well. :)
Nice course! I am a beginner in Python. Now I am being able to write my own functions and learn about the data structure. The video tutorials are pretty straightforward and instructions were provided to scope the problem. The graded assessments truly tested our skills in Python. Though some problems seemed very simple and similar to those that appeared in the lessons, many were quite difficult and involved critical thinking and problem-solving. I have access to all the code used in the lesson exercises which make the graded assessments easier to complete and follow along with. Once again, great course, and I recommend it for the beginners looking into computer science and programming.
Course Level - Beginner. My Level - Beginner with course studied in University for C, C++, Assembly language. Lecturer - Dr. Chuck is knowledgable in Python, he is professional in teaching, he is insightful in learning, he is a fun and kind person. Cost - the monthly subscription is worth for me as I almost took one course a week. If you believe you can commit that amount of time per week, then this cost is super low for you. Next for me - I will be learning the next few courses under this Python for Everybody specialization.  And after this specialization, would go on with more data science course.  So I would like to invite all of you to start and continue learning together.
The course provides all the content you need to learn as a beginner in python. Once you learn everything you also need to workout on your own.. i did it. i spent just an hour after learning each module and then practiced it, went through material and understood. The material is very easy to understand, instructor is very friendly and never makes any of the course classes boring! If you are planning to take any course on python, i strongly recommend this course. I really enjoyed it. It was more like a friendly discussion rather than a regular college class hearing some boring content.I sincerely wanted to thank the Instructor Dr. Chucks for providing this course and content!
Excellent course focused on strings, files, lists, dictionaries and tuples making a clear reference to how these can be used to analyse data. This is probably the first time when I finally understood when we should use lists, dictionaries and tuples as I always had them all mixed up :) This proves excellent teaching skills  of Dr. Chuck  as it is a challenge to explain these things to "newbies"/"dummies" but also for those who already had a taster before to make sure it's all well understood. This is a second course in the specialization and together with the first one is setting a very good base for more complex assignments that will be discussed in the following courses.
I am really happy to be in this course and more happier to have a teacher like Dr.Chuck! Every Student must have a teacher if not  a parent like Dr.Chuck who enacts to be the teacher of their kid. The way he teaches is so interactive and he is so cheerful and supportive from his words. Yeah but I am sad cz' I cant afford myself a certificate. I wish I could and some day I will work harder to earn more and earn myself a certificate from Dr.Chuck. Only a few teachers can give you that spark and support like Dr.Chuck. GUYS AND GIRLS don't miss this teacher or u may regret it! CZ' the course will then be just a walk in the park under the guidance of Dr.CHUCK! Thank You Sir.
The course of Python Data structures offered on coursera by University of Michigan is a nice course followed by Getting Started with Python. In this course you will get almost enough knowledge in python to write some good code, like you can access files on the computer and extract something out from that. Instructor is particularly very nice and frank type of person. He teaches the course in such a way  that you will not feel any pressure of anything during the course. Assignments are also easy even if they look hard at first sight. Everything follows from his lecture, so listen to his lectures carefully and I swear you will not feel boring during any lecture.
I really enjoyed every minute and every assignment I have passed during the course. Dr. Chuck is really cool and awesome instructor. I am really looking forward to take another course from him. I also liked how the vides are and their style of teaching, especially office hours are amazing. I hope Dr. Chuck will come Madrid or Istanbul so I can finally meet him. Assignments are a bit challenging which is super good for learners to always be able to repeat what we have learned along the videos. To sum up, I can easily say that these two course are definitely two of the bests that I have took, and I really want to continue to the next one as soon as possible.

The Python Data Structures course run by Dr Charles Severance has been informative, instructive and overall just great. Having tried to learn Python from a book before and had trouble with it I decided to start Dr Chuck's course, which I can say has really paid off. Dr Chuck provides a casual yet very educational way of teaching, and teaches/guides you through every step of learning the fundamentals of Python programming. I also found the student curated notes catered for the course very helpful for when I forgot something in the lecture.

Overall a fantastic course and I hope to do more of Dr Chuck's courses in future!
The course was perfect for my current circumstances. I have been working for quite some time and wanted to freshen my skill set. These courses fit perfectly into the busy schedules of modern families. I strongly encourage other associates to consider taking the courses as well. They can easily fit into a Sunday afternoon or after work, if not exhausted.The content of the course improved upon the first course, and touched on subjects I was curious about but never completely understood.I plan to take more courses as it develops interests into skills without the HUGE expense and pressure of a degree type program which would not fit into my current life.
This was an excellent course. Professor Severance did a great job of explaining the different data structures available to Python programmers and their best use cases, which is something I was hoping to understand more thoroughly. The exercises are challenging but attainable and always build on what you've learned in class or through other exercises. I felt that the Programming for Everybody class was almost too easy - it certainly wouldn't be for a novice but it is for anyone with programming experience - however, the Python Data Structures is something that everyone but a very experienced Pythonista will benefit from. Highly recommended.
Again, this is an excellent course following the first course in this series. The difficulty rised up a bit, but the course was prompting students to combine what they've learned in the past classes and complete assignments.
Some of the assignments I spent hours on, which was quite uncommon for the first course, but I really gained a lot rewriting and revising my errors in codes. It's less about mastering a programming language but more of learning to think logically like a professional programmer. I enjoyed the feeling of sorting my own brain out.
Thanks for Dr. Chuck and Coursera for such a wonderful course. I will continue the study.
Again, the same review as this specialization courses' first module, just phenomenal. I am a complete newbie to coding, so I am learning a lot, and there is a very enjoyable information overload (if you are into that sort of thing). Plus, I am really getting into enjoying the ecstasy after properly executing a program. I would highly recommend anyone interested in learning Python to take this specialization course. In order to learn better, I keep Command Prompt open on my side, and I keep executing my commands line by line (wherever applicable), and that also is aiding a lot to my learning. I cannot wait for the next module.
Another great class from Coursera and UOM. As someone who did a larger portion of my undergrad and all of my graduate studies online, I am incredibly impressed with the makeup of these courses. The content is well organized. The quizzes and assignments are easy to execute and 100% aligned to the subject matter. During the course of my MS in Decision Analytics, I can't tell you how many times the week's material seemed completely disconnected from the formal tests/assignments. The discussion forum feedback is great and incredibly quick. Excellent experience and great knowledge for the future. Thanks Coursera and Dr. Chuck!
"Python Data Structures"  was the 2nd part of basic python. I am thankful to Coursera and University of Michigan for giving this opportunity. This course was so much enjoyable as previous one. I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Chuck for his great teaching. I am proud to be a part of this course. This course was covered 6 to 10 chapter of the textbook “Python for Everybody” and I took only 12 days to finish this. Now, I focus on next course "Using Python to Access Web Data" which is beginning of advance python. I hope, that will also as much enjoyable as previous courses, specially when the instructor is Dr. Chuck.
Dr. Chuck is an awesome instructor, the focus of this course is a narrow one, you will learn a lot of things, but will remain oblivious to a wide variety of things outside the focus of this course if you don't do the work to look around the Python community and read up on the various methods and functions available outside of the ones taught in this course. Also, the bonus material at the end of each week is a welcome change of pace that serves to, in a certain way, humanize the community and the instructor more, so that they do not remain mere images and voices on an electronics device. Great course, would recommend.
Fabulous course.  The lectures are good.  Quizzes and assignments have started to be, applying what you've "learned", not just regurgitation.  Very nice.  The bonus material show how the different technologies are related and the genesis of many of them by individuals who participated in then.  Very cool.  Thanks much.  It was most enjoyable.  I also like that you can move at your own pace.  If you're new to the profession, a quick learner or re-tooling, it's move as fast or as slow as you want.  This is been very helpful for myself.  I'm retooling and have become a "college" student again.  Great fun.  Thanks much!!

This was a great course! Building data structures was fulfilling and the first time you actually get to see Python do something useful, well more useful than printing out prompts or calculations which a calculator could do faster than you typing the code. Dr. Chuck is a great instructor and he has helped convince me this is where I need to be. I will go back and find another course to better my skills because the few projects you do in this class aren't enough for me... I want to be able to listen to a problem and know exactly how to write a solution in Python.

Thanks Dr. Chuck
The lectures are
  very well structured and the flow of each lectures flows greatreference support and reading material is

  life in the future
Very Awesome, robust beginning course in programming that covers a great deal more than I would expect in a beginning course.  Python is so ellagantly simple I think, and that is what allows so much more to be covered relative to what might be covered in other languages.  Plus, the added bonus of Dr. Chuck's HEROIC ICONS of PROGRAMMING interviews are an especially appreciated in their rare, personal view into the mind and personalities of quite a diverse and very awesome developers that started out at some point much like many of us and kind of gives you the hint that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!  Mark Regan
Took this as "Programming for Everybody"--my very first programming class. Loved it. It was hard from time to time, but well worth it. It's not likely I will do programming for a living, but understanding this medium makes a big difference for me when I encounter issues related to technology, data and the web. I believe everyone benefits from some exposure to the world of programming. And this is by far the best course offered online. This part of the class isn't always easy, especially if one starts from scratch. But persist--the course is so well structured that eventually everything comes together.
This is my second course of the Python Specialization, and I think it covers all the content about the data structure in an easier way and concise. Also, it gives differents strategies to analyse differents types of information and how to obtain specific dates (e.g. explore different ways to extract some datas from Excel or similar files, calculate this data given its information) from the big quantity of these files. I liked this, because you can explore more in detail the different tools that it gives Python and motivate the student to learn and apply these concepts for different applications
A very good course even for a programmer! I was from a C++ background. The way Dr. Charles Severance explains things in a really friendly manner is so easy to understand, it's as if I am learning from a friend instead of an instructor. I breezed through this course so easily. I finished the first course in the specialization in 3 hours, and this one in 2 days. However, this does not mean it's an introductory course. It'll give you deep insights into everything. This course indeed is "Python for Everybody" (focus on 'Everybody').Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn Python.
It took me like 20 days to finish this course. I not only felt great taking this course, but also I felt like enjoying it. The content, the slides, the assignments is all appropriatedly arranged. Especially, Dr. Chuck is really enthusiastic and interesting, and I guess I can never forget that hilarioius graduation ceremony. Through this course, I learned some basic data structures and dealing with files, and I wish I could learn more about dealing with data and perhaps build a program without instructions. Thanks to The University of Michigan and Coursera, I really gained a lot!
This was my second course in coursera and also programming for everybody. This was a brilliant experience for me. I have come from a totally different background but because of my interest an mostly about how influential the instructor (Dr. Chuck) was and also the whole course all the assignments and the quizes helped me get through this.I will keep learning and will try my best to finsh the whole specialisation course of python as the more I'm getting in the more I'm liking python. and also the comunity the teaching stuff, the studesnts from the forum they are really helpfull.
It was very enjoyable to learn Python in this course.  I have programming experience so it was easy but the way this course was taught compared to other online classes I have taken is exceptional.  It was fun and instructional.  Seeing video of other students around the world and the fun that Dr. Chuck convey throughout the class made it so enjoyable.  Thank you very much to Dr Chuck and all his collaborators on this course.  I look forward to one day to meet Dr Chuck and personally thank you for being who he is a very giving individual and inspiring many others to do the same.
I liked the whole setup of the course as it perfectly matched my learning process and the instructor too was a good teacher and greatly discussed all topics in the lectures and materials. I just felt pretty calm while learning each topic as there weren't any worries or doubts that occurred in my mind. Thanks to the instructor, Dr. Chuck, for creating such a great course.Topics like dictionaries and tuples had created a deep impact on my skills of python as now i find them very useful to solve programming problems. The bonus videos also proved to be informative and interactive.
I have really enjoyed the course. Learning the basics of different data structures helps me appreciate all the python packages I have used before to do some quick analysis. Writing the code helped me to understand the theory better. This course gave me confidence that :1) I can finish a course in Coursera 2) I can code. I have done coding before, but I have been away from it for more than 7 years now.Things to improve: I personally the text editor in the assignments is a bit iffy sometimes. The same piece of code works sometimes and doesn't other times. Or may be it's just me!
I loved this course, maybe even more than the foundational course. Dr Chuck is really funny and gives good examples that help new information stick better in the mind. The mentors are also very helpful with their comments and timely in their responses. I also appreciate that previous forum posts by past students remain accessible, so we can try to find if someone else in the past has had the same problem before, so we can try to figure out how to solve our problems ourselves. I am very grateful that Dr Chuck and all else involved have taken time to teach this particular MOOC.
I found this to be a great introduction to python data structures. The way everything was explained made them easy to understand and, even as someone with a little bit of python experience, there were new things to learn. Videos and explination were all understandable and the excercises were, in my opinion, a good challenge and helped reinforce the things you learned in the lectures. I reccomend this course to those looking to learn python and, specifically, to those who completed the first part in this 5 part course or want to learn more about lists, tuples and dictionaries.
The level of detail and varied resources in this course were great. You have access to really well-done written material in a physical or e-book, you have the course videos, which are engaging and dynamic, and the instructor is animated and "real" for lack of a better word; he explains stuff rather than just giving a demo of the capabilities of the language. And then you have quizzes and real exercises to practice. It's the exercises that really help me, because I learn by doing. These were difficult enough to provide a challenge, but not impossible or frustratingly complex.
It was an exceptional and amazing journey, I had not expected that tutors on Coursera are that much experts, they are fluent and know what they are doing and not even single time he hesitated. Great Job, Sir if you are reading my review, I just wanted to hug you. I have a request can you please make a course on JavaScript. I am a very enthusiast of javascript, but I haven't found that much good teacher, whom I could understand. Mine concepts regarding this course are crystal cleared. Thumbs Up, I hope you stay safe and happy always. An inspired student, M.Zubair
I rated this class 5/5 because the instruction, content, resources, and pacing are all excellent, and this course is true to its description.  Highly recommended for anyone who has taken Python for Everybody (Getting Started in Python).  These two courses are a best match for someone learning their first programming language.  Learning with Professor Severance is fun, in bite-sized pieces, and with just enough challenge to keep you engaged and moving forward without getting discouraged.  Professor Severance has mastered teaching programming at scale.  Thank you!
Dr. Chuck makes the 2nd course easy to follow after the very first intro to Python basics. The exercises are more complex but all the info has been given to solve them. I've learned that even though we are at the very beginning of knowing a programming language we can keep going. Maybe I'll try what Dr. Chuck says and have another intro python class and when I'm more comfortable I might join a programming camp, so I can switch job. Definitely this course made clear that I like learning about programming and I'll continue learning with Coursera and Dr. Chuck.
OK, things are getting real! Now you start to see the power! In terms of difficulty, the difference between this and the first course was quite big. I enjoyed it, but I made the mistake of not dedicating enough time and not doing enough extra examples. If you really want to get the most out this course and get to know python, then this course will make you realize that you're going to have to put in some time and keep it fresh. Otherwise, the list comp side of it and how to manipulate structures is not going to come easy ... trust me. Still, very cool.
This 2nd course of Python specialization (Python Data Structure) really made me love Python and coding in general. Dr. Chuck has taught so well that literally all my doubts got clear till the end of the course. If you want to learn python than there is no better medium and course to learn it from than Python for everybody specialization. Also the teaching staff (TA) is very helpful ,all the doubts or problems that get posted on discussion forums get answered within reasonable time and they don't ignore anyone, each and everyone's posts gets responded.
Really great course for someone who has no (or little) programming experience. It was amazing how quickly we were able to write code that actually accomplished something. Dr. Chuck is a great professor and explains the concepts very well. His passion is contagious - I'm really excited to learn more Python and more programming! At the end he also gives great tips on what to do next - how to pursue Python and computer science, how to approach getting a job, or how to use what you've learned at your current job. You have nothing to lose - take the class!
while there were parts of this course that I struggled with, there were really good forums(mods) to help me guide me in the right direction. while they don't give you an answer they do guide you in the right way to help you complete the assignments. I liked the pace of the course as it has broken down in very easy to understand videos.After completing the course I felt that I had a better understanding of what was covered int he course and when looking back at my notes and some earlier video laugh at how much I have learnt over the last week or so
Dr Charles is really a good teacher in Python. His presentation skills are encouraging for beginners like me in this particular language and it is also enjoyable. I was struggling to learn this language and have searched for several resources online but none of them were able to make me comprehend the basics of Python. I am happy that I have come across this course taught by Dr Charles. I have already completed the first two of the specialization and hoping to continue with the remaining ones which will help me gain valuable skills in Python.
Well structured course.  After completing the first course it is safe to play the video lectures at x1.5 speed and still absorb the material.  The course can be completed in a day or two over a weekend.  Be prepared, most of the assignments deal with parsing string data but I found it to be an excellent way to get used to syntax structure of loops and data structures.  The professor works through the assignments after you have completed them and that presents a great opportunity to check the efficiency of your code compared to a professional.
The instructor has made learning Python structures more enjoyable and digestible. Each exercise is a buildup of the previous knowledge. Every concept is interconnected, and as we get deeper into Python, data structures are ever more important. They are the basic building blocks. As a  learner, I have discovered Python isn't as simple as the instructor has made it to look. And this is a nice thing because it keeps me going and wanting to learn further. I like the way the lecturer has focused on imparting the basics upon which I can polish.
Very good. Two suggestions from my point of view would be: First, it would be even better if some flashes/animated films be used to illustrate the logic behind python programming. The trace of the electronic pen seems a little bit hard to catch sometimes. Also, as a learner who doesn’t live in the US, I sometimes find a few “American English” words/slangs hard to understand, for example “blast off” and “histagram”? Although I can guess what they mean, but still it would be better if more “International English” can be used in the course.
As the second course in the specialization, I continue to find the material covered to be useful and fairly easy to learn. Between the first and second course, I feel like both courses were able to lay and build upon a foundation of knowledge with each chapter covered. I did find the second course to be a little more difficult, but one would expect this with the addition of more code learned. However, I still felt like the graded exercises weren't too difficult to complete as a beginner to Python. Can't wait to enroll in the next course!
Before this course, I have had many bad experiences in learning coding, so I hated codingbut while I am surfing the internet and I read about image processing, machine learning, ...etcI found me interested in these fields but I found that I have to learn Pythonso I decided to take this coursenow,I love Python, the instructor (Dr. Chuck) teachs python in very simple way and he is amazingnow, I can say that I took the first step to start in my goal to learn more advanced application of PythonThank you Dr. Chuck for this amazing experience
Chuck is an amazing professor. It's engaging and fun. I have had sooo many professors that make you fall asleep, but this guy is just amazing.The course is easy if you have done anything with coding before and is a good simple starting point for everyone that hasn't done any coding yet and wants a first good introduction to it.The course plus some googling helped me write a script to automate a pretty tedious task at work. And that's exactly what's so amazing about it. Python can be used for anything and any industry, job, etc.
The professor explains very well, especially for beginners, to understand the concepts, and picks out on areas where we usually mess up the most. Areas that beginners wouldn't be able to notice if no one directly told us about, and will spend another few hours trying to debug the codes. The slides are also prepared very well, it helped visualise the output of the problem we are trying to solve. Overall, will definitely recommend this course to beginners or those that need a refresher on the basics and data structures of Python.
This course is amazing and teaches some really cool stuff that you can do with data structures. There are three basic data structures that the course touches on: lists, dictionaries, and tuples. In addition, the chapter on files puts together pieces of information that you learned in the previous course on getting started with Python. What makes this course fun is that it provides the right amount of theoretical information with contextual examples to help illustrate the concepts. Overall, I highly recommend taking this course.
Short lectures, good notes, and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well.  Although it was more difficult than part 1, I still found everything very easy to digest and understand. Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python. For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science, Take CS50 on EDX. That course is very challenging. I'm taking both at the same time and although different languages (C and Python), they serve as a nice counter balance.
The course is great and Dr. Chuck is incredible. I started the course 
with high hopes, trying to learn something during the pandemic and 
completely fell in love with programming, I'm an undergrad physics 
student and although I love physics more than programming I feel like 
this is a path I want to keep pursuing, I'm sure that what I've learned 
and will learn will be extremely useful in my field, thanks Dr. Chuck, 
thanks for introducing me to the world of programming an giving the 
initial tools to finally get started.
Very clear.  The thing that separated this from other python is that he shows non-trivial uses of the code, so when you learn about things, you understand how and why they are used, not just the syntax.  For example, I've taken a couple intro courses that were not as good as this.  I knew what a tupple was, but there was never a really good explanation of why they would be used, and that limited my understanding of them. There were concrete use cases for this and all other content.  I can't recommend this course enough!
This is the second course in the Python for Everybody specialization. The course is really structured for beginning programmers, but programmers experienced in other languages will find it useful as well.Dr. Severance (Dr. Chuck) does an excellent job of making the concepts clear and understandable. The exercises included in the course are somewhat limited, however. I strongly recommend using outside activities (Dr. Chuck provides a few sources) to reinforce basic syntax and methods, as you will be using them often.
I learned a lot from this course. Between paying attention to indentations and understanding why certain lines of code need to exist to make the proper output happen. I absolutely love Dr. Chuck and the staff (specifically Tamara Brunnock). I really enjoy that the mentoring provided helps push your thought process to the extreme and allows you to actually learn and understand whatever it is you're struggling with. I love this course, I love the people and I'm super happy that I was able to accomplish what I did.
Great course!  I've just finished it. I did the one before this as well, and I intend on keep going with the specialization in Coursera. I learned a lot in this course and already was able to apply what i learned in a "real world problem" (or rather a project of mine). It teaches the basics very well and has a lot of exercises in just the right complexity for being able to apply everything learned without feeling lost nor feeling like it's too simple. I highly recommend it if you want to get started with Python!
A very wonderful follow up to the first course in this specialization.  Each topic is presented in a way that is clear to understand.  Assignments increase slightly in difficulty, but are still very do-able.  And the graduation ceremony at the end is a nice touch as well. Overall, very satisfied with this specialization so far.  Feel like I've got a good handle on fundamental programming concepts now, and am excited to continue on to the next course!  Thanks so much to everyone who makes these courses possible!
To be very frank, I was dubious about concepts of python,which I gathered from many other python teaching platforms, when I was enrolling this course.I already had taken an introductory course of python before from the same course provider. Mr : Charles is indeed an excellent teacher. I find it relatively simple and easily understandable, when he explains the concepts . He is being crystal clear in his teachings and I would like to thank him for that. Very well explained and helped me a lot. Thanks a lot sir
The Python Data Structures course run by Dr. Charles Severance has been informative, instructive and overall just great. Having tried to learn Python from a book before and had trouble with it I decided to start Dr. Chuck's course, which I can say has really paid off. Dr Chuck provides a casual yet very educational way of teaching and teaches/guides you through every step of learning the fundamentals of Python programming.Overall a fantastic course and I hope to do more of Dr. Chuck's courses in the future!
Again, Dr. Chuck has given a fantastic extension of the introduction into Python. In this course we learn the basics of actually managing some simple data - the mind begins to tick over with possibilities. The course is delivered in a fun and lighthearted manner, with examples and anecdotes, and presented in a manner that is engaging and motivating for those who are taking this course online. Definitely a fantastic course and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to making the jump into coding and Python.
First of all I would like to thanks Dr chuck for such a wonderful graduation ceremony. 
This course is wonderful. I am a mechanical engineer, doing phd. Machine learning is a part of my phd work,so i started learning python programming. Before joining the course i was thinking that python might very difficult and i was do not having any programming backgound, but Dr chuck made it so easy. Thank you coursera for this course. Its a wonderful opportunity to learn python on coursera by Dr chuck. 
all the best
This course is a little bit tougher and tedious than the first one within the specialization. This is due to the contents themselves, which are basic and a bit boring. However, they are quite important since are the building blocks for future tools and apps to be developed using Python. Luckily, Dr. Chuck makes it quite easy and bearable, as always. So it is not difficult at all to complete the course (Dr Chuck rules!). So, you should have already signed up for the course. Came on, you are running late!
The course is very good for someone starting out Python programming. The course is well structured and the quizzes and programming assignment are based on what is taught in the class. The course talks about inbuilt data structure in Python such as strings, lists, dictionary and tuples.  At the end of every week there is a Bonus Section, which is fun.
The conversation with Rasmus Lerdorf (inventor of PHP), Brendan Eich (Javascript) , John Resig (JQuery) and Douglas Crockford (JSON) is simply awesome.
The course is so awesome! As usual, concepts are very well explained by using good examples. I have also taken Dr.Chuck's Python for Everybody course. I am a beginner in learning Python and have some programming experience from my school's class.  Honestly these two courses together have helped me most in understanding and using Python. I have also taken some other Python courses but these two really are the best for me. You can start from scratch and then build up step by step. Strongly recommend!
Wow. The whole course was awesome! I really like the hands-on approach you chose to build this course around. I completed several Bootcamp, but I find;t even know how to open a file and create something valuable. But now I know how to read files, parse them, extract data, sort it and print as valuable information. The end of this course was absolutely amazing - I was watching the graduation ceremony with a wide smile on my face thinking how lucky I am having a chance to learn from Professor Chuck.
Python data structures is an excellent course that i would recommend, if any one is interested in learning python. Each and every topic was clearly explained by Dr. Charles Severance.Each week has an assignment which provides a good practice for what we learn in that week .I would most likely recommend this course to everyone.Also, I appreciate Tamara Brunnock and other teaching staff help in clarifying quick questions in assignments. I committed to complete the 5 course specialization of Python
Great experience as a hobbyist. My first Coursera course that I actually managed to complete. Graded Assignments are very good, they test a student in most areas and probe alternate ways of writing code.Professor is great, love the tea toast and the graduation hat :). Thank you Professor Severance for this wonderful course.Only one feedback: The Quizzes are way too easy and in most cases doesn't require any critical thinking on the part of the student. The complexity needs to be increased a bit.
It's an awesome class, although got stuck in the experiences for much of time. And the discussion forum is not very helpful, since everyone's strategy is very different and there were  not similar to what I encountered. And not allowed to post codes is totally understood, but didn't find a good way to communicate with the TA without posting my codes. Hope there is a way to solve this. In spite of what I wrote, I've learned a lot from the class, Thank you very much to Dr. Chuck and the TA!
Dr. Chuck is the most outstanding professor I have ever seen. He is very kind and patient. The course contains the basic algorithm and data structures in Python. Although it will sounds very difficult to get involved in, I feel very comfortable to watch the lecture and finish the quiz and assignments. This course is very helpful for me to develop the big picture of programming. I look forward to finish the series of Python course instructed by Dr. Chuck. I really appreciate his guidance.
Python is my second Programming Language, after Java. And after doing the two courses, I am pretty confident about the fact that this is now my Favorite programming language. The course was amazing, fun, informative and very helpful. It took me two days (6-7 hours in total) to complete this course. I could manage to stick to it because it was fun and easy. It covered the essentials quite adequately. I look forward to complete more such courses and start working on projects using Python.
Dr. Chuck's Python sequence here on Coursera is a MUST TAKE for anyone interested in programming.  In the second course, I found the content much more applicable to the kinds of data problem solving that I encounter in my work and understanding how to read files of data and turn those into usable data structures to manipulate the information found within is invaluable regardless of your profession.Keep up the great work and I am looking forward to taking more courses in this sequence!
Dr. Chuck is my new favorite teacher. This course is very engaging. I had no prior knowledge of programming but I always wanted to understand how it all works. I really appreciate all the hard work that goes into making these courses. Dr. Chuck makes it easy to understand by breaking it down to the lowest possible levels so even a novice like me could eventually understand and create codes of my own. I definitely would recommend this course to my friends and to all who want to learn.
It is great to go over so many details of Python data structures, learning about how they are regularly used, and some of the caveats of using them, such as learning what kinds of methods each structure has, and how they produce sometimes different datatypes as output. The work was not exhausting, but yet was still challenging. I think the lessons are well designed so that they don't take a large amount of time but still include several concepts at once that need to be balanced.
This course has been one of the best courses i have ever taken on Coursera. The professor was so motivating and cheerful that i was able to complete the course in a span of 5 days, it gave me such a level of confidence regarding my programming abilities that my college wasn't able to give in 3 years. The course content and the problems are top notch for a novice programmer. I'm really looking forward to doing more courses from University of Michigan under Prof.Chuck. Thank You.
Dr. Chuck has been my favorite teacher. I have taken plan to finish all the courses. I didn't see yet any teacher like him in my whole life. He teaches students with fun. Needless to say that no teachers beat him. He is a fantastic man. This course seemed to me awesome, I enjoyed it a lot. I recommend everyone to take this course at least if you are in run out of time. But, the first course of Python Everybody (Specialization) should be taken to understand this course clearly!
Thanks everybody from "Coursera and Michigan" for this course.Special thanks to Dr.Chuck.I did programming in C/C++ in my college days back in 2003.Latter i joined job in telecommunication service industry,where programming skill was not required.In quest to change my carrier I thought of learning PYTHON.Initially I was little worried,will I be able to complete the course, as I was not good at programming.But later realized this is even suited for not so student like me.
Excellent course, Excellent is the word I would use to describe the course. Though I am not a newbee to programming, I am not programming for work since several years. So it really helped me to start with the very basics. The course material is designed with exercises which I could relate to real world application. This made learning even more interesting. 

All in all worth the time I invested and I was able to finish the course much before prescribed time.

Thank you.
Amazing course! Such useful videos by Dr. Severance. Text book is a great extra tool to refer to when studying for the exams and doing the assignments. The teaching staff and mentors are always really helpful on the discussion Forum and it only takes a couple of hours max before receiving a response. This specialisation courses encourages me to learn more about these topics and to prepare me for a masters degree in data science. Thank you team, keep up the good work.
Hello,I was learning the first part of this course. First few days I was not able to understand many things but things changed & now I am more confidently exploring the area of my interest & wandering here & there  on this site as it is my second home. I am really fortunate that coursera & UM provided me this opportunity to get this course. Thank You Coursera & UM for your kind support for students like us who are financially challenged. Thank You, thank you so much.
This part was a little more difficult then the first one.  I would have liked a place to write smaller programs which would help to solidify new concepts since they are a bit more advanced. However have said that I think the assignments were excellent in that they make one think more and make you have to understand what you have been taught  to complete them. Great course that I would recommend highly to anyone wanting to learn Python. Excellent teaching Dr. Chuck
This course is an excellent continuation of 'Getting Started with Python' - all of the lecture material and the content in the provided textbook complement each other well, and the instructors who are there to help in the forums for each class are extremely responsive and supportive. I'm thankful to everyone involved for the introductory information about programming this course provides, and for the sense of playfulness and inclusivity they bring to the material.
The assignments really helped in solidifying what I learned through the video lectures. I was also encouraged to work through them on my own with similar examples provided (walkthroughs), which is the most helpful part. This is one of the best online classes for programming I took. One small improvement they can make is on the software that is used for submitting the assignment. It constantly changes my indents into multiple spaces and gave me errors quite often.
Similar to the first part, this course is amazing. I cannot stop saying that Dr. Chuck is such an engaging professor, such that he really transmits to his students the passion he has for programming. As he says by the end of the course again, this course is extremely helpful for all those who have zero background of programming, as the main purpose is to learn basic foundations and the logic behind, that can be useful when learning other programming languages.
Professor Severance is great. Very clear in his explanations and I really like how each video is an in-depth look at a specific example. The videos also build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned. I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week's material.
Python file operations, most of them dedicated to read the file, parse line by line and implement some sort of manipulation in order to see the application of lists, tuples and dictionaries. Also you will find yourself implementing some string slicing in order to meet the grade expectations. I already knew the data structures that were being applied here so it didn't take more than one hour to complete. It was a nice refresh for some methods I had forgotten.
Video material is great: professor goes to the point while giving appropriate examples and also keeping the class interesting and friendly. Exercises are not just a "copy" paste of the materia, they challenge the student to really solve a problem with the tools given. Also the extra material (free pdf book) is complete and adequate to the course. Moreover, the quizees on each chapter guarantee that the student pays attention to the theory. 100% recommended!
This is the second course of the Python for Everybody track. The lectures are clear, with good examples, and easy to follow. The quizzes and assignments cement new knowledge admirably, and are not insurmountably difficult for the beginner. For those with a background in shell scripting, it's possible to complete the course in a much shorter time, as much of it will be relatively familiar, conceptually. All in all, a great introduction to Python data types.
I generally love programming. Nothing makes me happier than coding. Dr. Chuck class has been brilliant. I really want to meet him and talk to him if I get a chance. His classes are very informative at the same time very entertaining. At the end of this course, he presented us with POV graduation ceremony. This is a huge confidence booster. Dr. Chuck also motivated me to dwell deep into my passion for programming. Thank you Dr. Chuck. Thank you so much.
I am so grateful for this course. I've completed first course of this specialization course. I have been searching for a course like this from a long time ago. When I first started programming I didn't know where to go and what to learn in my first C++ programming. But here in this course our instructor has made it so simple to learn. Thank you for such course. I am looking forward to completing all the courses and get the specialization certificate.
It's really a good course for someone who wants to learn basic of Data Structure wth Python. The assignments were not too difficult but provides good revision and application of what we learned in the course. Also the interview of famous Computer Scientist that the course has was very informative and I sincerely appreciate the effort taken by the Prof. Charles Severance to provides these interview session in this course. Thank you Professor Charles.
This was my favourite course in the specialization, because it required a lot of learning through the assignments.  I loved it! The instructor, the learning material and the assignments were all top class, and just at the right level for a beginner. Maybe as a suggestion - and in hindsight I think this course could do with a few voluntary assignments where one has to use all or most of the skill one had learnt, just to reinforce all the principles.
Following this course has been a very engaging experience. The materials provided to learn (videos, lectures and assignments), as well as the bonus videos, keep one motivated to pursue until the end. I have many times before learning to program online but I failed because the courses were not following a clear structure. With Dr Chuck, now I see the world of programming from a different perspective and I am eager to continue developing my skills.
I took programming course on other platforms before, and I don't know whether it was because those were on Java or because they were really not as good, but with those courses I always felt like I wasn't getting the whole picture, and felt really helpless whenever my code threw an error. So in this course it was super helpful to actually see Chuck write the code, debug it and fix it because that really helped me to get into the process of coding.
I really enjoyed this class.  I have taken a variety of programming courses, and this one just rings true for me.  Professor Severance is an outstanding teacher with an ability to convey meaning to the subject matter being taught.  If I was afforded time and money, I would seek out his classes at the university he teaches at.  I am learning a lot in a way that has real world application.  I can't say enough praise, so accept a humble thank you.
I would describe this course simply saying that the experience in solving the assignments and taking this course by one of the amazing instructors, Dr.Chuck and delving deep into Python feels incredible ! And I strongly feel and believe that Dr.Chuck has this amazing distinctive capacity of making any person madly fall in love with programming and of course Python ! I strongly recommend this course to everyone irrespective of their background.
I liked this course. It taught me a lot of new things; of course, you have to invest time to be able to complete the assignments, and also takes effort to comprehend the topics, but it pays off all your hard work if you want to achieve some knowledge about Python.Also, professor Chuck is a great teacher and easily explains the topics. I appreciated all the effort to share your knowledge with us, and my thanks to everyone who made it possible.
Great! The instructor is unbelievebly comptent, funny and likeable. The structure of the course continues to be excellent, while getting considerabely harder. But the rewarding feeling after having mastered the excercises after every chapter is extremely addicting. And most importantly, I made great progress and feel like I now have the necessary toolkit and knowledge to tackle real tasks. Can't wait to see what the next course has in store.
As I recall the original Introduction to Python Dr. Chuck course which debuted 3 to 4 years back or so, was split into two. So this is is like the 2nd part of the original course (split into 2 as it was deemed slightly overwhelming for beginners). With the properly adjusted pace of this class, even with knowledge of Arithmetic only and NO programming what so ever, you should do well in this class provided you make at least a moderate effort!
Dr. Chuck's courses are amazing. I took other intro to python courses before but got lost pretty soon; but with this one I really understood every bit of it. It is very good that Dr. Chuck shows you how the parts interact with each other using lines (sounds basic, but for someone new into the programming world it is very useful). I really recommend taking this course and the previous one. As for me, Im  planning on taking the next courses.
I never thought I'd ever have this much fun programming. This course is slightly more challenging than the first one, and you will have to(or at least I had to) do some practice to familiarise yourself with the little details. The concepts are made easy to understand thanks to the wonderful Dr.Chuck, but they are similar to each other, so a lot of practice is required to properly remember what commands must be used for what data structure.
I really enjoyed this course.

I already knew some python and this course taught me that I haven't forgot what I've learned in the past.

Now I know that I need to practice more to grow my skills. The 
examples and assignments were just right to reach the desired level of 
knowledge for an almost beginner, as I am.

In the next class I hope to learn how to deal with more real life problems.

See you soon and thank you very much Dr. Chuck!
This is a excellent course, I have been around programs from quite a while, back then if you knew ANSI C you were highly qualified, but now days you need to be fluent in so many languages and frameworks that is easy to get lost in the little details. Dr. Chuck is very dedicated to create a nice experience for those that need to go all over again from other(s) language(s) to Python but also for the fresh minds starting in the SW Dev. world
I am a UG student from a Mechanical Engineering background and I tried to learn programming languages before and I couldn't but now I think I can now do small programs in python and complex one with more practice and the thing I noticed is that compared to other MOOC courses on python few points were missing in this course other than that nothing else and Dr.Charles Severance is an awesome teacher and thank you for teaching this course.
As good as the first course. I am happy that I have got an overview of what python is and how it can be used in day to day situations, thanks to the lecture materials and Dr. Chuck. I wish you a wonderful health and prosperity sir. Lots of gratitude. Secondly, I would like to mention that the book has to be read along with the courses to get even more insights and ideas about the respective topic. Together they make awesome fireworks !
Systematical step-by-step program which can be followed by anyone willing to learn. The lecturer is not only knowledgeable, but also knows how to explain notions and concepts to newbies in a way that you will never be overwhelmed by so many new information. I have attended quite a few courses so far, but with this one I constantly feel a sense of accomplishment and progress making. Chuck and wonderful mentors, thank you for everything!
This is my second course with Dr. Chuck and I love it! The course is very well organized and the instructor explains the material in a perfect way: every lecture is very well structured and the lectures are very consistent. I also thank Dr. Chuck for his general advises about how to learn programming languages and how to use it in life. Either if you are a professional programmer or just use Python for your own purposes.Great course!
The approach that Dr Chuck takes to teaching Python has been the best experience when trying to learn a computer language. Everything he uses are building blocks to other very relevant areas. His book and lectures are very relevant. I have been analyzing data and building business intelligence solutions for years but I always wanted to learn data analysis with Python. Thanks to  Dr. chuck & thanks to coursera to offer me these course
Excellent course on Python data structures. Taught me a number of interesting things I didn't know and gave me a better fundamental understanding of the structures and how to use them effectively. Definitely improved my knowledge and skill with Python and the instructor is awesome. He puts things in very easy to understand terms and is primarily focused on you understanding what's going on and not jargon or rigor. Highly recommended.
I used to be aversive to computational languages and always tried to stay awayfrom them, but the way prof. Chuck teaches has comletely changed my approach. Thank you so much prof. Chuck for considering that there are people who know nothing about rogramming and then designing a course that beautifully caters to their needs. Your teaching style, the content and your funny jokes make the learning process much smoother and interesting!
Dr. Chuck you are awesome.The more i learn the more humbled i about feel how much work you have done just to let every one learn.This is first course i took because i wanted . Here in India its said you pass engineering first then decide what you wanted to learn or become .You have made learning fun . I really like when i have to fight with assessment tool to get my program to pass.  Shaking your hand is on my Bucket List.-Vaibhaw
Dr Chuck does a great job not getting bogged down in the minutiae ... What I would recommend is to capture "what" you're doing as you go with each assignment so that you'll have a resource to return to when you need that code snippet later.  For example:I keep an INDEX.txt in same directory as the assignments.  Here's an example entry:assignment10_2Read file (emails)split for time, then hour (:)histogram of splitsorder by keyHTH!
Definitely  one of the best courses for people with barely programming background. Dr. Severance gives a very detailed explanation to the definition and shows examples step by step, especially the way he guides you to think of a problem. Though it looks quite simple, it gives you a very fundamental thinking to the programming language. Watch the lecture, do the assignment and get more exercise for practice, then you will be good!
The course is great, quizzes weren't only to emphasize the given information but also to advance the theoretical knowledge of Python.what I liked about the course that I had to understand what I'm doing and the code I'm writing although I'm not a super-smart learner I managed and surfed the web to understand more and I still have too much to comprehend but like Prof. Chuck said you can learn and struggle and no shame about this.
Charles Severance is a warm and brilliant teacher who makes learning programming both fun and easy. The information was presented in a way that made it memorable and fairly easy to understand.  I found the assignments in this course adequately challenging, but more importantly - interesting to work on! I am delighted that I picked this course to learn Python, and it makes me look forward to the rest of my programming journey!
Excellent class! Was not a big fan of online courses; especially technical material but Dr Chuck is awesome. So engaging and he really makes the class fun. Really like the bonus videos as well as the format. Each chapter/ section broken down into small chucks so easier to digest. Small sections was also helpful if because if a certain concept was unclear it was easy to just go back and re-watch or re-read. Highly recommended.
As usual, not only is the content great, Dr Chuck also makes lessons fun and interesting! Totally recommend this specialisation along with this course as it can really build on your python foundations. Took another python course and learn about dictionaries, list etc but it was not as detailed and clear however this course managed to clear up all the gaps and now I'm more confident to say I know about python data structures!
Python Data Structure offers a deeper understanding of the Python language after the first intro course UMich offered, and it's very useful to everyone who wants to learn about Python. Dr. Chuck did a fantastic job in making this course easy to understand and enjoyable to learn. I'm really glad that I've taken this whole Python for Everybody series courses and appreciate the great work Dr. Chuck and the staff team have done.
As the first Python course in the Python specialization at the University of Michigan, I also loved this one. I will continue to learn more about Python in the next specialization course. Dr. Chuck is great at explaining the concepts and the material is excellent. The use of colors made the explanations clearer. I think the course should have more exercises or more tasks because it would help all students to practice more.
I find it very interesting , i can easily revisit certain topics which i need to remind. Also through the assignments i was able to remember the basic of Python.The quiz and assignments at the end of every chapter helps me to test my knowledge and know how much i have gained through this course. It's one of the interested course i ever had.Thank You Coursera, Dr. Chuck and Michigan University to offer such a good course.
The exercises were tough, but doable. Everything you need you can figure out by reading the book and watching the lectures. The teaching assistants in the forums were outstanding-- no matter what time of day or week it is, they always seem to be available to provide just the right amount of guidance to nudge you forward. The instructor was clear and explained everything in a way that was easy to comprehend. Great course!
The best python intro course ever! Side notes: I feel like you don't even need to take the "Python 4 everybody" to get started, you can directly jump to this "Python Data structures" as long as you spent a bit time playing around python by yourself.Strongly recommended new python learner download the videos explaining lists, texts and dictionaries, and review them frequently until all of these become very natural to you.
As an IT Specialist with specialization in Networking and Troubleshooting, I found this course very useful as it empowered my to understand the basic programming using Python. This will become very handy in developing programs. I look forward to take similar courses in order to advance my knowledge. I am not changing from Networking Specialist but this is a good course to broaden my knowledge. I enjoyed the instructor.
I took the whole specialization which I strongly recommend over individual pieces. These courses go through a book provided by Charles Severance. He includes all the material and TONS of code he made. Charles goes through all the code he brings up in the class and explains each piece. There are fluff pieces throughout that are not necessary to pass but offer some history. Overall a great course with a great instructor.
This course was great!
Dr. Chuck makes the material fun and relatively easy to learn.
Just pay attention during the lectures, and take your time with the quizzes & assignments.

Do yourself a favor...
When you get an assignment correct, TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF IT.
Include the question, your code, the result of your code, and the expected answer in your screenshot.
It will be a tremendously helpful reference point for you!
I liked this course because it teaches you the data structures in python which is the starting point for programming in python. There were some things that I did not know and compared it to other programming languages, and I realized that python is very elegant when writing code, it is simple. There is not much problem in coding, python understands and makes it easy for you. That is why I liked python and this course.
This portion of the course did a really good job in introducing data structures.  I found that the last week's assignment really helped me understand using different data structures as well as how important it is to keep track of what types of data structures different methods return.  If someone were already somewhat knowledgeable about programming I would suggest they start here over the prior portion of the class.
This is my first time taking programming course but this course make me to understand the basic of programming and will like to recommend it to all beginner like me in the field of programming to take this course.Thanks to coursera for their free education provide to some of us who are unable to afford for high tuition payment.Thanks to the professor of this course in honor of Dr. Severance he is truly a professor .
This is the second course by Dr Chuck that I've completed. Again, never thought I'd get into programming, let alone find it fun. Dr Chuck is excellent at explaining concepts, and turning incomprehensible jargon into bite-sized chunks. This second series takes more time and effort than the first Programming for Everybody course. I made sure to review again and again, and yet again, prior to tackling the assignments.
This is a course I would recommend, it covers the basics in data structures and have enabled me to do alot of stuff I couldn't have done or understand without it. Having already embarked on the next course this course is something I came back to again and again to re-watch the lectures since they are really helpful when you need to freshen up on stuff like "how to handle a dictionary when faced with a yaml-file".
This is really a great course. I learned a lot throught it. I am a student major in Literature and aways curious about programming. To be honest, I was kind of scared of programming in the past. However, after taking this classes, I wrote many lines of code by myself and solved some real tasks. Now I am totally not terrified at all. I believe I will keep learning programming in the future. Thank you, Dr. Chuck!
Exceptional course. Dr chuck is just an outstanding teacher, who keeps things simple and knows how to make you stick the face to the screen for hours. I can't recommend this enough and I can't thank him more for making me discover the world of programming. I will keep working on other programming courses to make projects a reality in the future. I wished I had studied software engineering when I had the chance!
It's such good course to study after completing first course of Python specialization .It will help you gain some beginner knowledge about Python language . Also the teacher of this course are really good . He will gives you all kind of information about this course . And the speech of teacher is really understable. hope you all like this course as me . Than you Coursera for having me as a part of this course.
Absolutely wonderful. I've learned so much over these past few weeks! Professor Severance's class structure, that's based off 'Think Python' by Allen Downey, is way more user friendly than it's "100% computer-science" counter-part; providing a thorough approach to learning the syntax needed to get you a solid grip on the fundamentals needed to learn actual computer programming theory; thanks again Professor!
Really interesting course, I really enjoy the class with Dr. Chuck because he makes easy explanation of different concepts in programming that makes the excersices easy to solve. I have learned about data structures, a topic that I barely had knowledge and I hope I can apply this new knowledge in my future master course or at my future work... Keep doing videos Dr. Chuck, greetings from Caracas, Venezuela!
The course has been so well driven. Many thanks to the entire developers of such a lovely platform and especially my instructor Dr.Chuck(Sir. Charles R.Severance) who made this course an infinite loop of fun learning. You are best sir. Please Sir try I have only one request: Kindly made the assignments and quizzes more complex and some what more difficult. you are best and Coursera rocks. Thanks alot...:)
Amazing! It was easy, I am in middle school and took this course wanting to know how to build a discord bot, with absolutely no knowledge in coding. If I was confused while doing an assignment, I would look deeper into my code, review the videos, and find my mistake! It was really fun and satisfying to finish an assignment after so much trial and error. By far the best class I have ever taken in my life.
This course has been well structured and I must say all the programming assignments were too good to understand the basic concepts of Python Data Structures. Prof.Chuck is the best professor when it comes to teaching python. With the help of this course, it made my career transition from Mechanical to Computer Science smoothly. With this Course, it sparked me to go towards Algorithms and Data Structures.
Great course to follow up from the 1st course in the specialization. Provides the basic concepts needed to know regarding the different Python Data Structures. The quizzes and assignments were more challenging compared to the 1st course but provide a good way to consolidate what we have learnt from the lectures so far. As usual, the lecture videos were entertaining to watch and learn as well. Thank you!
One of the best Python courses I have taken. Loved Dr. Chuck's lectures as usual and the progression of this course is perfect for someone coming from the first course in this specialization. I would recommend not to rush through the course to get the certificate. It's important to make sure you understand each line of code in the exercises as this course is when you really start writing some cool code.
Professor Charles, takes up, Programming, in a passionate and enjoyable way, And the Bonus videos, on tech Entrepreneurs are really inspiring, Be it solving practical examples, or the slides, the concepts are crystal clear and learnt a great deal in the course. I thank sincerely Coursera, Prof Charles and University of Michigan, for their sincere efforts to help learners from distant  spheres like me!
Great, an excellent approach to Python in my case with no previous programming experience. It goes step by step incorporating new meaningful blocks of knowledge you can use and practice at the end of each week. Material really well developed and easy to understand and follow. Excellent experience as part of the whole Python specialization. Thanks for sharing this so well prepared course and knowledge.
Great Course for beginners, without any programming knowledge.I am suggesting to take this course before you will do any other courses. This course helped me to learn on other python courses, which were overestimated as "for beginners" but needed already some programming knowledge. In this course all assignments are based on learned material (based on lecture). I am glad that I took this course first.
An amazing course by the University of Michigan and Coursera. This couse covered the basics and advance data structures in Python as well. The instructor, Dr. Chuck did an excellent job in embedding the and put those basic skills to the test in writing advanced python programs. I will certainly recommend anyone, who is new to programming or even has some experience in programming to take this course.
The course of Python Data Structures taken by Sir Charles Russell Severance (University of Michigan) via coursera was very informative and helpful for me to get started with python. The tests and assignments helped a lot. The concepts were explained very well and I had lots of fun taking this course. Thank you Sir Charles Russell Severance, Coursera and University of Michigan for the wonderful class!
This is my 2nd course in the series and it steps up the game a little.  You learn more about the capabilities of Python while causing you to think a bit more than the first course.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and Dr. Chuck made it a worth while challenge.  Thanks for another excellent course and I'm looking forward to the 3rd chapter of the series Course 3 - Using Python To Access Web Data.  Thank You!!
Thank you so much, Chuck. I stronly agreed with what you said on the graduation ceremony. As a chemistry major graduate student, you know,  only chemistry skills cannot give me enough competition on job market. I would really say thank you for you and this course. I hope after several years, I will get great job and can use the python skills you taught me, and after that, I will tell you. I promise!
First of all a hearty thanks to Coursera and the University of Michigan for providing me with such an a wonderful opportunity to learn python data structures. File handling in C language always seemed to be a daunting task for me and i truly hated it. But thanks to professor Chuck and the amazing simplicity yet much more effective python language i was able to overcome this challenge data handling.
Excellent course! I am also doing a course on bioinformatics algorithms and the code challenges in that course were very easy to program using Python as the language! It feels great to actually be writing programs that have some real-life impact! All thanks to Dr. Chuck for his wonderful way of teaching and his  beautifully written book. I am definitely going in for the next course in this series!
Took Python Data Structures immediately following Python for Everybody. Loved both courses!! Even as a novice, you can knock each out in a couple of days. It felt really good to struggle through some of the coding exercises and finally reach an "aha!" moment, and then go back and improve my code with the skills I learned soon thereafter. If you are interested in coding at all, I highly recommend.
It was absolutely an amazing experiance learning from coursera as i can list down all the pros of enrolling in this course 
i.e starting ,from short videos in different chunks to fitting quiz at the right time and 
adding fun videos to get rid of boredness,it seems to have been most organized online learning platform I have ever interacted with.
Many thanks to the Coursera team...you guys rock !!
Very informative and nice course. With Dr Chuck learning never is a boring experience but it is fun learning. I did not find data structures that easy or may be requires more practice but Dr. Chuck made it very easy for me. Appreciate efforts taken by him and Coursera in bringing forth this course and making it easy for the entire learning community. Thank you very much Chuck Sir and Coursera!!!
Firstly i think that python for everybody is just an ordinar course an di was doing it just to add some certificate in my resume but with time i realize it's an extraordinary course.most difficult topics very well explained and also this course was focused on such topics which no tutorial generally focuses on!! but students always find difficulty in those.so, thank you for making such course.
Learning a programming language could not be easier and enjoyable than this. Prof. Chuck, He is the best teacher I have ever got. The way he explains through the program is the best possible way to understand it clearly. I would really recommend everyone to take this course if you are still afraid of programming languages this course is for you. Thank you, Coursera and University of Michigan.
When I started the series of this course I think that would be a challenger, besides I got some experience with Java language programing I was not sure if I could get this course in another language. I'm a Portuguese native language and I consider myself an intermediate in English.Thank you, Mr. Charles Severance for your dedication. I can say that I have learned more than python, thank you!
A very complete course. Good explanations that are not excessively long. The only downside I find is the lack of more practical exercises between videos. More exercises would be of great help to consolidate knowledge and not leave everything for a single practical exercise or sometimes two at the end of each week. I hope to continue advancing in the specialized program to which it belongs.
I have never such a approach to teaching programming language. It is a best course series so far. Never seen learning prog. lang. can be so easy. I remember in my first semester of bachelor's degree, they taught me c programming which i found very complex to the newbie like me at that time. I think education system in India should take more flexible and dynamic approach to teach students.
This course is awesome for a total beginner of Python. The instructor was very enthusiastic, encouraging you to take on the challenges. His teaching was very simple and fun to follow. Each week only took 15-30 min to watch videos. The rest depended on how fast you could get the assignment completed.  If you were struck with a problem and posted in the forum, the staff replied really fast.
The content taught in this course is more complicated than the first one - getting started. I did sometimes struggle with the assignments, since I didn't have the habit of reviewing the lectures and materials after each week. Have to pick up the book and work harder now! Although challenging, the course is still interesting to me, and I pretty enjoy the sense of accomplishment in the end!
So, when I started with the first course, I started gaining more and more interest because of Dr. Chuck's wonderful teaching methodology. This is really a great course. Dr. Chuck is a great man with a wonderful teaching technique. I wish I could meet or talk with Dr. Chuck and thank him for the courses and learn more new things from him. He is really a great teacher. Thank you, Dr. Chuck
As a former Java Developer for BI apps who is transitioning
to a Data Scientist/Data Analyst role, I would say Python definitely makes it
easier and more efficient to develop BI/ETL apps. But equally important is an
instructor who delivers the lessons in an easy-to-follow manner while focusing on
the real world use cases. Thank you Dr. Chuck and your teaching assistants for
a great job!
I really enjoy Dr.Chunk's courses.I have no basic of programing,I am a radiologist,in order to be prepared for the AI times,I decided to learn someting about programing.The certificate is much easy to get compared with the ML course,and I think it is a good fedback so that I can maintain my passion on learning the coureses.All the best to Dr.Chunk! Keep learning my fellow classmates.
Excellent course. It will take your newbie python skills to the next level and teach you lists, dictionaries and tuples (all python data structures). I found the assignments to be challenging but not hard. Spent about 2 to 3 hours per week (actually, I crushed the course over the Xmas holidays and did the whole thing in a week doing about 2 to 3 hours each day. Loved it!) Good luck!!
This class provides an introduction to all of the 'containers' used in Python to store and pass data. Charles Severance continues to provide excellent instruction on how these tools can be implemented and what they are capable of. Upon finishing this class, the student should know all of the basic commands used for building a program, along with simple techniques and implementations.
It was more challenging than the first course but well-paced.  I may have to review some of the basic things I'm not clear about. So I would advice not to speed through the course if you are complete beginner. I had to rush because I'm using Coursera for campus for free and I need to learn so much more in short duration. If you have no reason to rush, please don't rush the course.
An amazing course, in which my preliminary knowledge of Python Structures, was reinforced and updated. Some gaps were covered, thus setting a corrected path towards Python dominance. A very recommended course. Plus, I really enjoyed the extra material also (under the label of "Office Hours with Dr. Chuck"), and really loved and smiled at the "Garduation Ceremony" at the very end.
I enjoyed this course. I had some more difficulty in this one that the first in the specialization. For someone who is completely new to programming, this is not super overwhelming but it already gives some mind teasers in the exercises. I suggest that you read the book after you finished watching the lessons because the examples in the book really help you answer the exercises.
This is the next big step in learning basic Python programming. After the first course covers such important topics as "data types" this course continues with "data structures" which is how data is stored, recalled, and processed. This is crucial to understand before one tries to process information and gets back all types of traceback errors, "NoneType" and empty set responses.
In this course, you will be gaining a great amount of experience with Python in so smooth and easy way, the content is so interesting throughout the whole course. It will be so rewarding moment when you can read every line of the code that has been displayed by Dr. Chuck in first video of first course.Thanks to Dr. Chuck and his excellent team, you will have fun during learning.
This is a basic courses of Python. I have to admit that due to my experience in Python, I complete it in a single afternoon but the courses still gives a lot knowledge of Python through the bonus videos like author of JavaScript or JQuery, this is more helpful for me to grasp a sense of computing. And still, if you are new to Python, this course is definitely the one you needed.
Well crafted course help a beginner really understand the basics of python and how the use of data structures brings around a wide range of applications for which python can be used to help us achieve our goal. Professor Charles Russell Severance is someone who makes sure his teachings are never boring and really makes learning a new concept easy to understand and fun to learn.
This course really helped me learn more Python skills to use in the future and at school. Thank you for this amazing experience! I liked how I could work at my own pace with the assignments and quizzes. In addition, I learned how to manage my time better! Professor Severance was an amazing and engaging instructor! I would definitely recommend this course to other people!Thanks!
Took this as the second course in the Python for Everybody specialization. Dr.Chuck does a great job of explaining concepts so even beginners can understand. A week ago I didn't know anything about programming, now I am able to do basic coding and can start to piece together how computers think. Would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the basics of programming.
Excellent instructor, the course is more challenging than course 1, so this is going at a faster pace now, but the instructor still managed to pace it right and to explain every detail carefully. The instructor provides also very good tips about how to make the code leaner and more efficient. Finally, Dr. Charles Severance's sense of humour makes the course even more enjoyable.
'this is a very good course that you can recommend to someone regarding learning python data structures where you can type code and work on it that can save your hours of work physically by writing the code and now that work will complete in seconds . This courage also gives you courage so that you can work better and learn all the basic of programming and get confident in it.
This course gives you a solid understanding of the ways in which data
 is organized, stored, and accessed in Python. You'll be able to 
practice your problem-solving skills, and have fun at the same time.As in "Programming for Everybody," Dr. Chuck presents just the right amount of material and enough guidance about how to use the language features being covered in the course.
Instructor, course materials, information, presentation, everything for most part was very good.  Only complaint is the user interface needs a lot of work done so it behaves " normal "...  Even trying to fill out this review is some what of a pain as it's just awkward...  Phone access needs equal amount of improvements.  However, other than user interface, everything was good.
One of the best courses that I have ever taken. Loved the additional videos. Any beginner wanting to learn about data structures definitely should start from these course. The quizzes definitely tests your understandings and the assignments just makes the sweet spot for your concepts.  Really looking forward to complete all the courses in the specialization. Thanks Dr. Chuck.
Awesome!I completed this section of the training and I was hooked since day one. The impact has been so positive on me that I can now better understand the math behind the material and enjoy the process of becoming a software engineer(?), I don't know but the sky certainly is not the limit for me : )Thank you Coursera, UofM, and Dr. Chuck and his staff!On to the next section!
Continuing with part 2 of the specialization, this course was as good and interesting as the first one. Dr. Chuck knows how to lay the fundamentals of progamming in an understandable and easy way to digest the content. The best part is that you get time to practice and resolve by yourself each problem finding your own strengths and weakness and work into improve your skills.
I was entering into a bit of uncharted territory for this course, but Dr. Chuck got my back with his great and playful way of explaining even those concepts that may not be intuitive as first. Well worth the effort to go through this one as at the end of this you will find that you, like I, are now able to create simple programs that can carry out some tedious work for you.
Its a very good course if you are looking to dive into python coding techniques using it's special features like list, dictioneries and tuples. 
You should be able to write complete codes on your own by the time you are going to complete the course. But one thing that I would recommend is that it would be better for you, if you go through the course 1 of this full program.
This series of courses is the best courses that i have taken on Coursera. It has been really great learning python from Prof. Charles , he is really funny and makes learning fun too. He makes the most complex of logic very easy to understand. I will recommend all of my friend to take up this course. And will look forward to learning more from Prof. Charles and on coursera.
A very nice course stating different data structures in the python. The different methods and effective storage and retrieval methods are shown. Really friendly for beginners. Highly Recommended if you want to get exploring python. The instructor is one the best i have found really nice and jovial and keeping the mood of the lectures quite cheerful .I liked that the most.
A wonderful method of explanation and treatment with the topic... Truly everyone can understand python after taking the course. Just a suggestion, if you could also give some 3-4 examples of how pythons can be used in Image processing and Video processing Applications, it would be great (It would be fine if it's at the end of the 5th module of the specialization course.).
The course was really helpful to understand the basics on Python and develop myself on the field. Having assignments regularly was really helpful and Mr. Chuck's tutoring had been very good and sometimes amusing. In addition, I was really suprised when I realised that by attending this course I could get the materials of it. I recommend to everyone to take these classes!
Dr. Chuck is among the most amazing programmers and python professors I have ever met! The course content extends beyond the scope of basic python commands, and includes also programming stories, details about the development of programming languages, even office hours and fun scenes from around the globe in an attempt to get us excited and motivated for learning python!
From my point of view, Python Data Structures course is properly structured and explained which makes it terrific in terms of acquiring the core knowledge of how Pythn deals with the different data structures as well as how to face the most common practical problems to be solved via Python. Thus, I would consider it as a must to introduce yourself in the Python language.
>>> Hello world!:)well what can i say... that was a cool course! Gives you understanding of the basics and takes you to the first stages of the world of coding. To be honest, what i find really useful, is that Dr. Chuck gives you some practice along with theory. This allows you to utilize your knowledge straight away and go directly to your own projects if you have some.
One thing that I really liked about this course is that the videos are not too long and the assignments really make you think how to integrate everything that one has learnt from the beginning of the course (not just that particular week). Moreover, the bonus videos serve as an inspiration to keep moving forward and learn more. Thanks Dr. Chuck for this amazing content.
I love this teacher! Highly recommend this course!! If you're looking for an engaging teacher who explains things in a clear an concise way - this is it. The teacher is also pretty funny. I just really enjoyed this course and I was so afraid to try online courses because I thought I wouldn't be very engaged. This teacher definitely changed my outlook on online courses!
I am very fortunate to join this course. I also completed first course. Believe me or not, I have never learned any programming language what i have got in this course. Before this I know little bit of C language. But Python is very interesting to learn. I am enjoying this course very much. And I want to complete the full python specialization course on Coursera.Thanks
Very happy with the "new" Coursera platform. The changes have enabled you to take a class for a while, pause your progress, and then pick up where you left off - a feature critical for asynchronous online learning. Also this was the first class that introduced data structures to me, so I have no doubt I'll benefit very much in the future from the knowledge gained here.
I really enjoyed this course! Professor Charles is very good at explaining all the concepts in very simple yet comprehensible ways. I really appreciated that unlike most programming courses, the lectures are not eternal and boring but actually super entertaining. Also, the excersises were very useful and I feel that I really got to understand the concepts through them
This course is brilliant for entry-level programmers and builds nicely on the previous course (Getting Started with Python). Think of this less as a course equipping you to become a programmer, and more as an introduction to coding such that you can build on a solid foundation as you continue this process of learning at the very beginning of your programming 'career'.
This is a really fun course and lays the foundation of Python 
programming. The videos are concise and apt and therefore one doesn't 
feel bored throughout the lectures. All the in-built assignments really 
put you in the groove of python programming. So, all those looking for a
 basics course in Python, do give this course a try. Trust me, you won't
 be disappointed!
Dr. Chuck is just the best teacher. the course is very structured and organized, each lesson builds on the other in a very understandable manner.Good paste, more than fair quizzes and assignments.I would have added more assignments so the material will sync better, even if I know there is plenty online, I personally would have liked to see more on the "bouns" section.
Amazing course! I learned so much and it gave me the confidence to keep discovering and explore the world of programming! Dr. Chuck is a great instructor who motivates and makes learning practical and fun! I am so glad I enrolled in this course. I decided to learn python purely out of curiosity but, this may just be the start of something new and exciting in my life!
I recommend
this course given by Dr. Chuck. Topics are well taught and explored. This
course is not just for people without any expertise, but also for those who
already program but need to learn python and don’t have the discipline to do it
by themselves. Dr.
Chuck speaks in a really clear way, so even if English is not your native
language, don’t be put down by it.
Awesome course, I'd tried a couple online learning courses to help me learn to program in the past and Charles' intro courses were way superior.   Fun and succinct lecture videos, relevant examples to work through, and assignments that actually teach you how to apply the knowledge.  Thanks very much for sharing this with the world Charles!  Can't recommend it enough.
Great experience.  The videos are exceedingly well-constructed, and the assignments are paired well with them.
My only comment is that I think it would be helpful if links to the PowerPoints used in each video were linked below each video.  That said, perhaps it was helpful to the learning experience to have to stop videos and hand-copy the relevant code into my IDE.
It is the best course on Python, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a beginner and want to know how to deal with programs. If you feel a little bit difficulty, than you can take the Python basics course but that is just a basic knowledge. Dr.Chuck is a great tutor and his ways of teaching are too interesting that it makes me awake and focused in the lectures.
An awesome beginners course taught by a brilliant instructor, Dr.Charles. I started with zero python skills and I can confidently say that my programming skills have increased manifolds. The syllabus was well designed and the quizzes and assignments helped me apply what I had just learnt. Will be taking up more courses in the future, thanks to Coursera and Dr.chuck!
The way Dr.Chuck teaches the python , it becomes so interesting and easy. Thanks to Dr. Chuck and the entire team of Coursera for helping me to learn and guide about the basic things about new programming language. Hope i will do some more online courses. I got confident after completing the python programming for everybody and python data structure. Thanks to ALL.
the most effective and the best thing in this course is the teacher Mr.Severance's quality! He catches the learner's attention and explains all the things in a effective way. DON'T LET GO MR SEVERANCE somewhere else. I think he is unique in this thing.! And the course and examples,quizzes are good and teaching. I liked the course. Thanks to all the contributors!!!!
I am highly indebted to Professor Charles and Coursera for the marvelous opportunity given to me to take part in this course. Professor Charles mode of teaching has really made the course interesting and simple to learn especially  to those who has no prior knowledge of programming. I really recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning python programming.
All the class were awesome, enjoyable, understandable in a very beautiful way possible. like you Dr.Chuck even i love to meet up with all different people & you are a awesome Teacher.. i learnt python data structure in a beautiful way i can say.& This is the 2nd online class i have completed successfully & that too with Dr.Chuck!Online class are really enjoyable..
This was the best course I've taken my whole life. The whole series of programming for everybody is very well prepared and very grateful. I can only imagine the amount of time Professor Chuck put into this. this helped me alot and i'm sure it also helped my other fellow students too. I will recommend everyone to do this course if they want to get into programming.
This is an excellent course for beginners in coding as well as in the language of Python. With video lectures from a great mentor with crystal clear concepts and at times required assignment demonstrations, it is just perfect. It engages anyone to complete it in 1 or 2 weeks rather than 7 weeks. Thanks to Coursera and Michigan University for bringing this to us!
Very very comprehensive instruction in the teaching of python programming but also providing new information in programming methodologies and techniques. Greatly enjoy Dr. Charles Severance as an instructor.  My only wish is that too bad Dr. Severance was not a professor at UC Irvine back in the 80's I would have immediately changed my major to computer science.
Fantastic course! Chuck is incredibly thorough in his teaching methods and very engaging, as well. He does a good job of breaking down coding concepts that might be easy to confuse and putting them in mathematical or every day terms that anyone can understand. He makes me feel like I am actually typing a conversation with my computer, rather than complex coding.
Dr. Chuck is the best! I have been writing in Python for about a year now and didn't think this course would teach me too much. Although I did know the methods Dr. Chuck teaches about in the course, I learned some important details about their use as well as how to approach problems. I highly recommend for anyone seeking a sound foundation in Python programming.
Another joyful Python course from Dr. Charles Severance. Course were very dense, there was no boring details; give fundamentals, rest of it depends interest of the student. Also thanks for bonus videos and interviews. Most of them are very inspiring. I understand from Dr.'s courses that everyone seeing your job will enjoy if you enjoy by doing it. Thanks a lot.
Very great course overall.I'm happy because now, I have strong knowledge in the fundamental of Python, and that was my goal before to postulate into that course.I love how professor Severance takes his time to explain difficult concepts into a simple example.I'm happy and grateful for them, to make this course happen.Thank you, everyone, thank you, professor.
Really great course, highly recommended to anyone interested in learning different data structures, and how python takes advantage of each type to solve complex problems. Prof. Chuck takes you on the journey, and pushes you at the right times for you to experiment, and utilize the techniques that you have learnt so far to solve the assignments/quiz.Loved it!!
This course is a continuation from Course 1 and is part of the "Python for Everybody" specialization. Just like Course 1, this course is taught very well. For non-programmers, you get the most benefit out of this course if you take it as part of the specialization. There is a nice little treat at the end for those who stick all the way through this course ;)
This is the 2nd python lesson I got from Dr. Chuck. There is an ideal lecture and lecture sequence for someone who has no knowledge of programming. He tells you about programming from areas that everyone knows and never gets bored. The course flow does not force you and encourages you to work. You learn a little more advanced programming with each lesson.
Great course. Dr Chuck is eloquent, articulate, humorous, and concise. This course really helped me understand more about parsing and manipulating raw data. I've always been interested in tuples and Dr Chuck does a great job presenting the info. This was course 2 of 5 of the Python for Everybody specialization and so far, I'm very happy with the material.
Python for Everybody is an amazing course for python programming language. It not only includes the core subject of python but also it includes office hours of our instructor and computing conversations with different language inventors. Totally a wonderful learning experience with Dr. Charles Severance sir. Thankyou for delivering such an amazing course
This is the second course I took in py4e specialization. It starts using python to deal with some data, which is  more challenging for me. But I really enjoy to get deeper learning in Python and still Dr. Chuck's course is well-organized and very helpful. I do need to take some time to absort and review what I already learned before I take the third one.
This course was very helpful as a foundation to understanding how to work with data in Python.  I have used Python for graduate courses over the past 3 years and only now understand tracebacks and why I was getting certain errors in my programs.  I wish I had taken it sooner, as it would have saved me a lot of time and frustration.  Well done, Dr. Chuck!
Very helpful and well laid out for a beginner programming course.  Dr Chuck is great at explaining the details although sometimes I find it difficult to figure out the exercises because the answers are not in the lesson we just had, but eventually with help I can figure it out.  I am looking forward to the next course in this specialty.  Thanks Dr Chuck!
I think teacher is really good, he is humourous and explain things clearly. However if you really want to master Python, you have to write codes,not just the assignment,it's not enough.And when you get stuck, you need to check in the reference book(Python for Informatics). So I hope more and more students will enroll in this course and enjoy programming.
The transition from course one to course two has been seamless. I congratulate Prof. Chuck for designing this course so well. All the data structures in Python have been explained very nicely with proper applications. And at the end of this course, one becomes confident to use data structures for manipulating various types of data in a desirable manner.
Python Data Structures course by Charles Severence,a very intelligent,interactive and a good teacher is a great course to take if are new to python,the course consists of obviously python data structures (list,tuples,dictionaries)and it is taught well by him.I loved the course very much!!!!!!!!A must recommend to the people who are starting with python
Thank you for the opportunity to learn, to Dr Chuck and all the teaching assistants! I was struggling a little bit with Rice's second course intro to python computing course and taking this one together helped me to better understand the materials. The only thing is I wished there to be more practice problems, but it is not hard to find them on google.
I t is a great, course, quiz are not hard but they provoke an important questioning and are part of the learning process. Assignments are more interesting every week and strike the most important topics of the week while using remembering a lot of the past concepts. It will be great of after the course is finish the student could download the homework.
As many others have already written, this is an excellent beginner-level course. A variety of teaching techniques are used, with good lectures allowing one to copy and try examples before launching into practical exercises. The instructor is engaging and kept me interested and motivated despite this being online. I really highly recommend this course.
I was a newbie when I was taking the first course on this specialization. Now I have completed two courses from this specialization and I am looking forward to take rest of the courses as I find it very helpful and easy to learn. All credit goes to the trainer Dr. Chuck who explains everything so easily to the learners and also make those interesting.
Well laid out course, teaching is excellent.  Recommend you read the book, complete the chapter exercises and play with the code examples as you read.  Then watch the videos (they will be easy to understand at this point) and finally the quiz and assignments will be a breeze.  Essentially, "read & practice before you go to class" and you will succeed.
I was relying on the tutorials videos made by professor Severance in the first course but this one I spent more time actually understanding how to use Python in data processing. I was spending time to try to make it work which eventually sorted it out by myself. That was a great course. Thank you very much for doing this. See you on the next course:)
Exactly the course is very important for developing knowledge in the field of Python Programming. Everything in the course is fine but sometimes during submitting the assignment we get some problem when handling the file because the file is not available to us so we can't able to know whether we have to find "From" or "From:" in the lines of the file
I'm very glad I enrolled dr.Chuck courses. All four about Python. They're not too simple, not too hard for the first time.You're need something interesting for the begining. Something that will remind you that learning is interesting.Dr.Chuck courses damn fit for this purpose.Thank you, dr.Chuck, Teaching staff of University of Michigan and Coursera.
This course will get you started with Python. I am from Taxation and have found myself very comfortable with this course learning Python. There are many courses and reference books but in a couple of weeks they become very difficult to understand but this course holds up. Thank you, Dr Chuck and Coursera to make this amazing course available to us.
Great course. I got stuck on one of the assignment questions but the prompt reply from the teaching assistant helped me complete the assignment before time. The course was well-guided and the follow-up quiz questions were also good. Credits to the Michigan University team and Professor Severance. I would surely recommend this course to my friends.
A great Python course to take in my opinion, though I can't be talking about beginners since I did have a chunk of knowledge about Programming and Python prior to taking this course, I still think it was as good as it could have been, maybe some more hands-on exercises would be a nice addition but a great course nonetheless. Keep it up, Dr.Chuck!
A great way to expand the knowledge gained from the first course (Programming for Everybody) and start applying it to real world entities like files. This course is still the "basics" of Python but learning Data Structures is very important in making sense of raw data from any real world entity. As always, Dr. Charles Severance is a great mentor.
I love this course, i've learnt so much and Professor Severance is a great teacher. He can explain complex matters in very simple-to-follow examples and statementes, never ever being contempt (like many professors) towards the audience. A great listen, a greate experience. Love the assignements, i ust wish there were more of them! Thanky you all.
A really good introductory course on data structures in Python. The fact that the course's text book is pretty much the same of what is explained in classes videos makes it a really good reference source!Professor Severance is awsome and pationate for teaching. I really do recommend this course for anyone starting programming or learning Python.
Learned a lot on this course.  It provided a better understanding of what are the different Python data structures and how it is different from other programming languages.  It shows how easy it is to use Python and how powerful it is in handling data.  Love this course and enjoyed the graduation ceremony hosted by the instructor (Dr. Chuck)!!!
A well paced follow on from the first course in the series with nicely structured exercises that help build your understanding. The scripting excercises allow the participant to not only practice new skills but also require skills learned in previous lessons to be repeated, which helps cement a solid understanding of the whole course material.
Very clear. I felt like I always had the resources necessary to learn the material required to do the assignments, but it was not so available as to make the assignments trivial. The professor's lectures gave me a good insight into how he thinks as he goes about the task of programming, which is a really critical teaching skill, in my opinion.
The course is good. You will learn a lot of things. It is relatively tricky as ti progresses. And that's what you want cause you want the program to challenge you so that the reward is that much sweeter. The teacher makes every effort to make the course 'playful' as you'll see once you reach graduation. Overall, a nice way to start something.
Excellent pacing, learned all the necessary basics and was explained with expert delivery from professor. The mix of real world explanations and the most basic examples of each of the concepts of Python really helped bake the knowledge in. I look forward to taking more classes with this professor and engaging further into the Python language.
After taking the first course, this course makes me have a better understanding of Python language. Now I can write a programe with about 25 lines on codes. It only takes me about half a month to achieve from a beginner. As a result, I believe this course is really suitable for those who wants to learn programing but has no related knowledge.
After struggling to learn Python on my own a few years ago, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning it as taught by Dr. Charles Severance. There have been many "a-ha" or "lightbulb" moments as I read through his book and listen to his lectures. The class has been relatively easy to understand and complete so far. I look forward to the next course!
I found this course as good as the first course in the specialization. The only topic which needs a bit of improvement is the Tuples Assignment in Week 6. I found the explanation confusing and I had to refer to external materials. But this complaint of mine is very minor compared to the positives this course offers. An awesome course so far!!
God Bless!! Dr.Chuck for making this course so fun to begin with.The exercises were nice and you are able to apply the concept which you have learned.But the most fun things were extra bonuses material which make this course even more enjoyable.I hope Dr.Chuck will continue to entertain and enlightenment us on this journey to conquer python.
One of the best online courses I ever attended. The professor is a great, friendly one who would increase our interest in the class. with all the bonus videos and interviews of all the creators of different languages, it felt like a journey with the professor.I really appreciate his effort and want to thank him for this wonderful course. :)
This was a challenge for me, but it was worth it. I'm more knowledgeable about Python and how to write at least 10 lines of code. It's going to take practice but  I appreciate being able to refer to the book constantly, because it's so easy to understand. I am going to be leaning on the book for a while, and I'm glad I'm working this course
Dr. Chuck's clear explanation of the features of the language is directed in such a way as to make sure I understand the concepts.  I appreciate his lecture style and really enjoyed the extra videos interviewing different people about the languages they invented.   l thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and easily learned the key concepts.
I liked it! Thx. The second course I took and finished in this specialization. So I am up to finish the following 3 ones, and then, or somewhere in between get and parse that 400+ mbs txt file that was generated by ESB in logs and that is noone capable to split into readable peaces and analyze.And I feel like I gonna be capable to do it :)
Thank you for the lecture. I really appreciate the clarity. This course actually makes me feel really like a true programmer after figuring out the assignments and understanding the code. You could really feel the "upgrade". Again, thanks. I really enjoyed it all. (Very simple by the way, just really had to follow along and practice along)
this is a good course after I took the first course. it takes you to solve more real-life problems with simple code. So I am very much interested to take the rest of the courses as soon as possible. Thank you, prof, for your guidance.   Programming for Everybody(Python) on Coursera is taught by prof. Charles Severance. Yes it is valuable.
I love this course!  Prof Chuck does a wonderful job of laying things out one at a time, and anticipating questions or issues that beginning programmers might have.  The exercises incorporate each previous concept learned and are challenging yet doable.  I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to program with Python.
It was an amazing course after completing the  first one: Python for everybody. the instructor is great! After pondering over the assignments trying to figure them out, and when i finally get the desired output i feel sooo good! it gives a great deal of satisfaction and happiness. i feel confident about python till this point. thank you
This is my second course from coursera and Dr.chuck and i should say that the instructor Dr.Chuck is an amazing person.He knows a great deal about programming and he knows how to keep the student interested in the class.I would sure;y recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue this course further.Thanks coursera thanks Dr.chuck
2nd course with Dr Charles. I find his courses to be very informative and his teaching method is very helpful in understanding the topics fast.excited to complete the remaining items in the specialization and if Dr Charles has any other courses, i will for sure take it....would love to have an advanced python programming class with Dr C
I had already taken 'Python for Everbody' by the same instructor. I had high hopes from this course and it just delivered that. I am very happy that I took this class. This course introduce you the python data structures in a simple way. It is very effective for beginners. Dr. Chuck is one of the most effective teacher I've ever known.
Charles Severance takes something so seemingly technical and presents it in such an easily digestible manner with a great deal of enthusiasm. He also provides anecdotes that make the material much easier to grasp and retain. His approach to teaching gives me huge amounts of confidence as I train for a new career in the 'tech' industry.
This course is designed very nicely. It is very compatible to all kind of learners. Dr. Chuck has done a wonderful job on explaining concepts. The provided book is very useful to understand those concepts and it also helps to make them strong by solving problems from book along with Coursera assignments. I highly recommend this course.
I liked this course on Data Structures. It was interesting, challenging and a little confusing for me. However I think after using it in the real world, with more examples, one can get to understand this better. Module 1 and 2 are key to understanding the rest of the modules, as they are the very foundation to be able to under better
I have struggled with programming in the past and figured I'd never be able to grasp the concepts.  Dr. Chuck is an excellent instructor, making programming understandable to those of us who need to start from ground zero.  It is rare to find a professor that makes these concepts clear without going over a beginner's head.  Thanks!
A very good course to build your CV and to improve the chances of success in job placement in the future.Really helpful for aspiring data scientists and university freshers who want an introduction to the python programming language and for people who already have jobs and want to excel forward in their career by adding a new skill
Awesome course for everyone. This course teaches the basic of Python Data Structures in a very friendly pace, as well as easy to understand language. Prof. Charles is a gifted teacher who has vast knowledge about Python. Thanks to Coursera, Prof. Charles and his staff, as well as the University of Michigan for offering this course.
lectures were very good, however there were some issues with the text file for the compiler during the assignment,. The compiler did not let me call certain components of the list band kept giving me an error that it was out of range. Also it gave me errors with spacing that I could only fix by hiding compiler and bringing it back.
Great instructor! a very structured course which makes it easy to follow and learn new things without getting confused! However, would also recommend working on your own and solving more problems besides the ones in the course because 1 graded assignment per week doesn't seem like enough to fully understand and remember the topic.
I think the lectures were excellent, containing plenty of content and a periodic sprinkling of humour. I have programmed in Python for a couple of years but this course taught me some neat techniques  I hadn't previously encountered. I hope I can cope with the next part and am looking forward to the chapter on regular expressions.
It is an amazing course where you can learn how to programm in Python since scratch. I love the way Dr. Chuck gives the class because he is so funny and a great teacher from whom you can learn a lot of things. Thank you for all the people who got involve to make this course possible. You make us improve in our educational skills.
Really It's a superb course with the best assignments for practice. All the assignment questions are formed in such a manner that they clear all the concepts taught in this course and also superb explanation by Dr.Chuck is given. I would like to say that it's the best course in python.Thank you very much for such a superb course.
I am honored that i got opportunity to listen professor Charles severance from university of Washington, for people like me dreaming about meeting a professor form top university is next to impossible but through coursera i can listen to them, learn from them.  define my feeling right now as if my dream comes true.Thanks coursera
This course is packed up with a lot of information to use during the academic carrier of an individual. I took this course as part of my College's MOOC requirement and I'm glad that I did. This was indeed a memorable experience for us. A big THANK YOU to the creator of this course for creating such a wonderful course for us all.
The only thing I would like to see in this course is more exercises! Practicing coding is the best way to reinforce what you see in the lectures. It's one thing to watch someone do it and understand and another to do it yourself.Five star rating as the teaching is excellent and I'm looking forward to my next course with Dr Chuck
The only thing I want to say about this course is that the teacher or presenter or professor , in whatever words you want to call Charles with, He is a gem. I have no background of programming yet I have completed 2 parts of this specialization and credit all goes to him. His passion and zeal to teach students is just wonderful.
Oh the professor Dr. Charles Russell Severance is really an amazing man. I loved his course here. He made my conceptions clear. I am really grateful to him. The course  is full of fun. Just follow his lectures and his free book will be sufficient.  Those who want to learn the basic, i think this course will be helpful for them.
it was an excellent course as it teaches u from very basics to the level that u have never imagined that u will ever reach ....and there will be times when u write a code for assignments and u get stuck u wanna blow ur head off life why the hell this code is not working but eventually u will get the idea by revising  the course
I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and have learnt a great deal about python after trying many other courses and giving up and saying to myself "my brain just doesn't work in this way". Chuck is simply amazing!I would highly recommend the course to anyone who would like to learn pyhton and may have been put off in the past.
It's an amazing course to start your pyhton journey, each and everything is so ordered and the assignments are very good that make you understand each and everything very easily. Dr. Chug is the best teacher of my life so far, he's so good and teaching and make class more interesting. Also, the bonus videos are so informative.
Best course I've done till now in Coursera. The instructor Dr.Chuck is UNDOUBTEDLY the best instructor I have had. On many levels, this course was better than a physical class. Kudos to Dr.Chuck and Coursera. The contents of the course couldn't be more proper! Though as a beginner one might require more practice along the way.
Î highly recommend this class. I have learned a great deal about data structures and feeling that I can start to get around with Python! I am sure I will need to get back to these fundamentals from time to time. Video support from Charles Severance are of great quality! Thank you. Going for the next course in a couple of days!
This is the second course I take on the series and I think Dr. Chuck is fantastic. The lessons are short but with enough information to give you a good general idea. You still have to go out and do some reading and coding but that's what will ensure you understand the lesson content and get you to the next step. Great Course.
It was a struggle for me trying to work and take the class, however, Tamara Brunnock was very helpful and encouraging. Having the playground to run code, also helped, because there can be glitches with the editor and idle. I feel that I have a better understanding of the language and am excited to progress through the series.
Great class to get started in Python.  If this is your first language, it's a thorough introduction.  If you've taken another one of Dr. Chuck's classes (like Web Applications for Everybody) and learned PHP, it's the same concepts, just in a different language.  This part of the course is easier if it's your second language.
I really enjoyed this class, this was the first online class that actually challenged me to look deeper into getting what I need out of files. Charles ("Dr Chuck") has a unique way of explaining coding that explains now only the how, but the why also. This is a very good class if you want to learn the foundations of Python.
Python using data structures gives your python code so much capabilities to achieve more. Simple data structures with effortless implementation. Course contain covered it very well. I absolutely love this part, where the basics I learned are seen implemented and in action and suddenly everything makes sense. Thank you sir.
Charles is an excellent teacher. This course is highly engaging and It was pretty fun. Charles pointed out the most important topics in the book, and even make me aware that despite the great summary made in this course, it is still necessary to check and read the book that contains the whole info needed to learn the best.
It was great following up the course, I have completed the first two section of the course.You teaching skill are great,I consider myself lucky that I found about this course of you. Very happy that I have something good to learn in this lock-down situation. Thank you so much for providing such a great course free of cost.
You need to take this course just for the professor Chuck itself. it is not easy to teach someone something which is completely new. It is like teaching a,b,c,d's for children when they first enter school. Programming is like that and Chuck did an excellent job in teaching the basics of Python.I really enjoyed this course.
An excellent introduction to Python geared towards people without programming experience.If you already have you can still find it interesting, but maybe take one evening per lesson instead of a week.At the end of this course you will be able to start using Python and the most common data structures to solve real problems.
I very much enjoyed this course that I took as a continuation of the "Python for Everybody" specialisation. I am also highly motivated to continue with the specialisation.The lectures are short and crisp, the lecturer is very engaging, and practical exercises are woven into each module.I would highly recommend the course.
This course is really suitable for beginners or people who want to start programming for the first time with a different background in their personal job, I learned a lot and I love the challenges in each homework.I am full of thanks to Professor Charles Russell Severance who teaches us vividly, with details and calmness.
Dr. Chuck you rock, the way you explained all Data Structures are truly amazing. i used to hate coding during my Engineering days. The final year project i did in Electronics, i had my colleague to write C program for Control Valve functionality and i did all other part. i regret why i didnt find you during that time :-).
Also the 2nd course in this specialization is really good, I got through it quite fast but along the way I started to see the fact that I was making less mistakes and was able to fix my own mistakes without checking all the lectures again. I'm really starting to get it, off to the next course! BTW: dr. Chuck is amazing :)
I really should be thanking Dr. Chuck for presenting this course! I went through the course while using the Py4e textbook( that's available for free ). It was very informative and clear. The examples provided really helped me form my ow thoughts on the process i was gonna take to solve a problem. Definitely recommend it.
Prof. Charles Severance's teaching is absolutely wonderful. Before taking up this course I used to dread coding, even when I started, I thought I would end up failing but this course started right from the beginning and it gave me a lot of confidence in programming. This is by far the best course I have ever seen/taken.
Thanks Mr. Severance, I really enjoyed  Python classes! I was struggling a lot as an engineering student, since I was feeling that I imitated how the lecturer wrote a piece of code. The syllabus is easy enough for anyone to understand. I really do appreciate your work and hope to also enlighten others with my knowledge!
Amazing course. I learned the data structures in Python in detail. The prof makes the course fun to learn with all his enthusiasm and office hours videos and other videos. He explains everything in great detail. Thank you so much Prof. I can't wait to finish the Specialization and earn my certificate. Thanks a ton Prof.
I quickly got convinced to take the other courses in this series after taking part in this course.  I started programming Python out of need to complete my thesis work, so there were many things about data structures in Python that I was not aware of.  Recommended for beginner programmers with little or no CS background
Super useful. all of these examples are useful in real life and the instructions and explanations were clear and understandable. Dr. Severance is an amazing professor. Can't wait to start the next course! The course was very easy for me as a CS student, but its also very clear for people with no programming background.
Python Data Structures is a great course for anyone who is interested in learning computer programming. The concepts taught here are very relevant to the field of Computer Science and apply to any programming language. ... Chuck speaks and teaches well, and he is very enthusiastic about the subject of Computer Science.
Awesome course! Thanks to Dr. Chuck! I really love learning Python Data Structures. I know how to program in C ++, but Python is simpler and more user-friendly. Plus, it provides plenty of useful tools and allows your imagination to flow better when programming than when I have to worry about parentheses or semicolons.
Dr.Chuck is my favorite lecturer.His way of teaching helps me to listen attentively even in boredom.And his bonus videos are really funny, useful and makes me to laugh at times and feel relaxed.In one of his bonus videos,he shared his visit to Bangalore,India.I also wish him to come PSG Tech,Coimbatore,Tamilnadu,India.
I'm coming back a few months after completing the first course to continue the specialization and the course picks back up GREAT. Since I am versed a little in python the course was easy, but just like with the first course, I was able to learn things I previously didn't know. I'm excited to move on to the next course!
The professor is really wonderful. He teaches the concept in such a manner that any person even from a non technical background can understand computer programming. It is really very awesome, thanks to such an excellent tutorial by coursera and university of Michigan. I truly loved it and it was a wonderful experience.
Dear Mr. Severance,It has been an absolute pleasure to take this course with you. Your simplistic way of teaching complex concepts is wonderful. Am very grateful to you and Coursera for giving the likes of me and millions other the opportunity to learn and grow constantly. All your courses are amazing. Thank you again.
I love this course. It taught me python programming from scratch and now I am able to do some simple programming and no longer afraid of scripting! Great thanks to the instructor and the teaching assistants who replied the questions in discussion forum so fast. Thank you all and see you guys again in the next course :D
The day I started learning Corsera Platform I learned a lot. I would to say about my experience with Coursera,i  loved it,I  have loved the learning I have been able to do and look forward to taking many more classes with them ... I don't understand the reviews with low ratings. I have never had any problems with them
I really believe this is one of the best courses reason being is the challenge it brings you and the journey of going back to material and being able to connect the dots especially being new in python and programming itself the lessons i learn here are not for the time being they are for life regardless of the outcome
Chuck!!! Thanks so much you are an incredible teacher and I can also tell an incredible human being.
Ofcourse im going to keep on going with the next certificates.
This classes are awesome and with this you allow that people with low or non income can learn, grow and improve their quality life. Thanks so much again!!!
Its a very wonderful experience learning this course.The course was taught in a very splendid way. Thank you to the professor who have been helping me throughout the course.The assignments are also very well designed such that one uses the whole concept that is taught till date.Thank you Coursera for the opportunity.
This was a very great experience, the quality of the course and the teaching was fabulous. For everyone who has just completed (getting started with pyhton) do finish this, as this particular course is a very important part of the overall programming language. I had a lot of fun learning this, hope everyone does too.
The Professor is excellent, slides are very helpful, and the course work is challenging. This is my 2nd course with this professor, and I would take another course with this professor. My only regret is not taking the time to meet other students. I really want to do that in the next course I take with this Professor.
Course is excellent for learning python : if you are an experience programmer in any other language, you can probably finish it in less than a week. If however you have no prior exposure to programming, it will surely take you longer, however you will end up learning the topics pretty easily. The instructor is great.
Simply superve course , I got very good programming knowledge of python looking forward to complete entire specialization. Thanks Charles Severance, you were amazing and bonus lectures of inventors of different programmin languages are very encouraging and you are doing very good job. Thank you so much for the course
This was a very great introduction to Data Structures in Python, now i can manage files and do crazy things to them, it isn't hard to understand separately, but this course helps to understand how they mix together and build a new kind of structure.Thank you for teaching!Python is indeed a very useful tool/language.
This help me a lot to learn python data structure and algorithm in very easy way also all the faculty members are so cooperative with me.                                                                                                           All doubts are cleared within an hours by instructors in Discussion form.
Strongly recommend this course to every and anyone, I am a Software Engineer that dedicated to other businesses more than 10 years ago, now with some extra time in my hands decided to learn new programming languages. Love programming. Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher. I'm really happy I found this course and took it
I will definitely celebrate that I have finally getting started with Python. Dr chuck is super professional and make all that things looks simple and easy to begin. I really grow up my interest in  Python and I would review the course content again, watch other basic level course and practice my programmming skills!
DRC , dr. chuck, continues to build the foundation started in the first course and then demonstrates how the lessons built from the trivial to the substantial.  I like how we the basics are intertwined with best practices in writing the code.  I plan on continuing this series.  The light-hardheartedness is wonderful
It had taken me to the next level of expertise in programming and gave enough confidence to take on data analysis using python as a beginner in programming. All excited to take the next level of the course to continue the learning. Thanks to Dr. Charles Severance and the Coursera team for this wonderful opportunity.
This professor was really engaging and I did not experience the normal nodding off when I watch lectures for online courses. I liked the assignments and felt they were challenging, but not extreme. I liked the bonus features at the end because it made the course a little bit more exciting than other online courses.
it was  a wonderful experience of learning Python Data Structure because it helps me to use python in various domain in a different way using these data structures.It helped me a lot in prototyping various unit-modules of project on which i am working.Thank very much Sir, for this course and your precious guidance.
Excellent course with an excellent teacher, I had a hard time completing the last assessment but I finally did it by my own! That's what I like the most of this course, that for people like me who are not used to programming, it turns out to be challenging yet it leaves you with a great satisfaction when completed.
Thanks a lot Coursera staff and Professor Charles Severance!!! Great job!!! The course is help me a lot. Python is my first programming language.  I started my bachelor degree in Information Systems at UFPE (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco) from Brazil, and our first discipline about programming was with Python.
This is a very good course for all those who want to begin with Python. Dr. Chuck has a very great ability to speak and express his views in a very simple and understanding way. Exercises in course are very good, where you can definitely test your learning and how much you have concentrated on each and every word.
I really enjoyed the learning journey the courses in this specialization offers.  They were delivered in very friendly manner and with the assignments were very helpful in understanding and grasping the concepts learned. Thanks to Dr. Chuck for this great course!  I'll definitely go for the next one in the series.
Excellent course module with a very dynamic instructor(Dr. Charles Severance). I just loved the way he teaches and the contents that he covered with so many exercises, assignments and quizzes. It was really challenging job to do the assignments. Thanks coursera  and a very special thanks to Sir Charles Severance.
This course is very useful for not only to new bees, but also the to the experienced one. The professor taught the tutorials in such a way that it will be understood by any one of us. The information which is taught here is very crystal clear with no confusions. Thanks course era and thanks University of Michigan
I have previously attended other programming courses and never really got in the groove. This course has woken up the programmer  in me and I am truly enjoying the experience. I hope to complete the five courses on Python programming. Sincere thanks to Professor Severance for his easy to follow style of teaching.
Dr. chuck is unmatchable. I wasn't sure about taking online course but my elder brother who is an Engineer at Intuit in silicon valley encouraged me to go for it and i am very happy to have virtually met with Dr. chuck.I am going to learn rest of the python courses as mentioned in p4informatics  book by Dr. chuck
Good intro to python data structures. If you are experienced in other languages, you will probably find this course very easy, but it still provides a decent foundation, and introduces you to some concepts that may not be present in your dynamic language of choice (e.g. there are no tuples in javascript or ruby).
excellent , I've taken course 1 and 2 (up to chapter 10 in the book), and subjects are clear. sometimes assignments were more challenging in this course but when you repeat the lectures and read more, at some point you make it anf you feel proud of yourself. you really get strong foundations if you are commited.
The course wonderfully completes the loop by making the student capable of writing and understanding the code that was shown on the first day of the first course. It makes you realize how far you've come without even noticing it because they made it so much fun and easy to learn. Dr Chuck is a wonderful faculty!
This is a really good way for us to refresh or even learn on python data structures from scratch. It would be really helpful to check out 'Getting Started with Python' once before checking this out for it uses a lot of the intro chapters of the textbook 'Python For Everybody' by Prof. Charles Russell Severance.
In this course i learnt a lot about python data structures. Earlier i used to think what are these used for?? But now i have good knowledge about its application in real word. It was great to be part of this course. All thanks to Professor Charles for explaining the concepts so nicely. He is a great instructor.
This a great course for people that wants to learn programming but do not have much free time and need a deadline to complete tasks.  I have learn a great amount in the short time. Though the book is free, I purchased a copy from Amazon so I can read it during my commute. I am telling everyone about this class.
It is a great course, this course teaches us the Data Structures in Python. On all that the Instructor(Dr. Chuck) is very Cool :) and the best, to teach Python. Thank You Sir for your time and your panache in teaching is one of the best. I Thank University of Michigan and Coursera for this opportunity as well.
Really good course! I completed the last assignment with my own codes without looking at much samples! woohoo! love it and I'd highly recommend taking it if you know the basics.
Dr Chuck teaches really well and explains things well. I just wish there were some exercises to  work on before doing the assignment.
Amazing course getting deeply into the use of lists/dictionaries/tuples w/ Python; Fundamental assets to start writing your own scripts to read file logs/gather info and present them as needed; I would have enjoyed more if there would have been additional optional exercises but completely worth it in any case!
Excellent course ! I learnt more about Data structures. The material were very easy to follow and deliver in a very friendly and engaging manner.I would like to thank instructor Dr.Chuck  for making this course amazing and enjoyable.I highly recommend this course to anyone just getting started in programming.
I love Dr Chuck. Thank you for all your effort in this course. I am starting to feel very comfortable with coding. I even build my first simplified Database management system of a website. Its always been a goal of mine to build my own DBMS system in my current job. I look forward to the next course with you.
I liked the way Dr. Chuck teaches the course. Always in a charming and exciting way. Learned a lot about the basics in this course. Simply the best interactive MOOC I have ever had. Thanks a lot! I will definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to start their path into the field of Programming using Python.
The course was user-friendly, informative and up to the mark.It helped me improve my error analysis skills and become a proficient python programmer.I expresss my gratitude to the University of MIchigan for availing students with such a wonderful course and to Dr. Charles Severance for his excellent teaching.
it's the second part of the python course.Dr. Chuck is really a great teacher and instructor.You will be directed to python programming with a clear understanding.I wanted to say more, but I only can say this:"This is a beautifully great course, and Doctor Chuck is gonna change you."Thank you Dr Chuck, always
Prof. Charles Severance conducts this course with an excellent pace using easy to grasp examples. I took Python for everybody and Python Data structures. I thoroughly enjoyed the course structure with the quizzes and coding assignments. This online course felt like a classroom experience. Thank you Professor!
Great course for beginners and intermediate students. Because I have skills in other programming languages it was not that hard to pass assignments. But I learned a lot: that in Python Strings are objects, manipulating files and new complex data structures like lists, dictionaries and so on. Thanks Dr. Chuck!
The course progressed at an easy pace, building up the momentum gradually. It is a perfect start for a beginner in Python(after doing the first course).Suggestion: Please provide some information about where once can practice further to hone the concepts learnt in the course. Thanks for the course, Dr. Chuck.
Pace is a faster than it was in Python for Everybody. However, as always, Dr. Chuck was simply sublime in his explanations and the depth with which he demonstrates certain concepts. The course definitely teaches you to put the concepts learned in Python for Everybody into practice for real, tangible problems.
I really enjoyed this course. It has been a excellent experience with good tutorials, interesting homework and funny videos. I started with the first level "Python for everybody" and the next courses have provide to me a new tools to be a Python developer. Thank you Dr. Chuck to teach in this phenomenal way!!
I never knew I had it in me for programming until I took Prof Chuck's courses.Like he says everyone can program, now I believe him. Thanks, prof for believing in us and teaching in a way that makes it easier for us to actually read and understand the course. Can't wait to start the nest course in the series!
I definitely find this course comprehensible and suitable for every beginner, as it was just my second course of the specialisation. I wish I had more programming exercises on a weekly basis so I could practice more pieces of new knowledge as not every one was covered. I'm thankful and continue this journey.
The combination of video with a text book to review helped me grasp the concepts and review them effectively. I enjoyed the format of the course. I worked out the examples on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.0. A lot of syntax nuances that would have been hard to grasp without the text book. Thank you Professor.
I really enjoyed this course and its prequel. Dr. Chuck, you are a wonderful teacher and I really appreciate the efforts and time you have put into each video. It almost feels like a breeze learning with you. I have learned a lot from your courses and hopefully will complete the specialisation in the future.
The rate is excellent. Dr. Chuck is very detailed and thorough. The first PYTHON course was the "Python for Everybody" which was fantastic. I needed to review data structures and file handling and this course is right on target for me. Thank you so much for your efforts and dedication, Dr. Chuck. (Six Stars)
Dr. Chuck is an excellent teacher,  give you a lot of details in each topic. The course is in English ,you need an upper intermediate level to understand the videos. In my case I'm from Perú and it was a little bit difficult to understand the language but hopefully I have previous knowledge in programming.
The instructor explains the topic very concisely and easy to understand. I learn that in programming, it doesn't matter if your code is longer than others, if it still works. There are still time to improve myself in terms of getting the job done efficiently. We learned it by experience. Thank you Dr Chuck
Learnt lots of new stuff,it was quite challenging because i did complete the entire course in 1 day.So for people who have already taken course 1 of python programming,by making short notes and practicing,this course can be completed easily.As always,Dr Chuck delivered the contents in a really good manner.
I felt a sort difficult in this course but I am fine with the topics and it took me hours to complete all assignment. well, I am happy to complete this course and moreover I need to refresh all the topics that I had learned. this is one of the great course to improve my knowledge regarding python.thank you
This course is really amazing, i would like to recommend it to everybody who is interested in programming but have no skills in it (or just a little after the course "Getting started with python").  Thanx a lot for Professor Charles Severance, your lectures are very easy-to-understand and with great humor!
Great and concise course for all Python beginners! Fun and informative lectures, understandable material and good (but simple) exercises. Here you will get pretty much what you need on data structures in Python, and the course is a natural extension of the first course in the specialization. Two thumbs up!
I took a python's introdution class in University a couple years ago. But I realiace I didn't learn nothing at that time. This course, on the other hand, teach me so much.  It encourage me to learn more about programming and try to earn my life doing this. The teacher is so nice. Thanks alot to Dr. Chuck.
Excellent, It clearly gave me insight into programming, where earlier it was a big mountain in front of me, clear understanding of data structure handling, Now i am confident enough to work further on python programming to build my skills further and later build applications relating to agriculture domain
Very good foundation Python programming language course delivered by Dr Chuck. Quite tough some times. I suggest you type all the program lines shown on his slides and pause the video, think about the result and then listen to his explanations. This is my second course and looking forward to the next one.
Absolutely a fantastic class and Dr. Chuck is amazing.  If you have any interest in Computer Science, writing code and programming, this is a great place to start.  Find out if you like it and want to pursue it or just give yourself some basic knowledge in understanding the basis of code and how it works.
can we have problems solved in classes i know they will be tough but we will give a try for every chapter or week so that we will have more explose that field. sir please think about my request. the only reason i am taking these course is because it was offered by your university and also beacause of you.
Thank you,Sir Charles Severance for teaching Python Data Structures in such a simple way that i completed this course without facing any difficulties. Now i am very excited to complete all the course of this specialization. And ones again thank for Sir Charles for improving my basic fundamental in Python.
I have enjoyed this course so much!! I had zero experience in Python,prior to this specialization,but now I understand and have learnt so much more.Dr. Chuck is a brilliant instructor and really broke this down into understandable chunks so it was easy to grasp.Looking forward to learn more about Python!
Professor Charles Russel is the best instructor so far I've found in Coursera. His teaching skills are fascinating. He does have these tricks to connect with students mentally, what students need to know, how they can understand, and all. I'd suggest anyone who is interested in Python, to do this course.
This is a great continuation to the Programming for everybody  course.  It is a concise explanation of the data representations in Python above simple values, variables & expressions.  Strings, Lists, Files, Dictionaries, & Tuples are covered well enough to get a basic understanding of manipulating data.
I now have a good understanding of Python programing, but I think I am a long way from applying this knowledge to useful purpose.  I am hoping that as I advance through the future instructional materials I will improve my skills. I think I would not have been able to accomplish this by independent study.
This is the second course in the Python for Everyone series which continues (and concludes) the introduction to Python.  The course's automated grading made it easy to continue with each assignment at my own pace; and the way the information is presented makes it easy to learn without getting frustrated.
Great course! Fascinating Professor!Recommend to everyone who wants to start learning Python or programming in general!Many many thanks to Professor Charles for holding the course and generously sharing his work with us! I've really learned a lot!Can't wait to start the next course in the specialization!
A very well designed course that gives just enough information in the lectures to complete the assignments without giving the whole answer away. I have been learning JavaScript on my own and paired with this course specialization I feel like I am slowly learning the important fundamentals of programming.
Great course.  It's a very succinct introduction to the basic data structures in Python.  Dr. Chuck is very engaging and easy to understand.  The assignments and quizzes provide a good measuring stick as to your progress.  The peer-reviewed assignments are a great feature.  I really enjoyed this course.
This is the only Python course I could concentrate in and proceed on.Prof. Severance gives students very important emphasis when he thinks that the students must understand something perfectly to step on to the next step. I think it is kind of warning, and makes me review the previous lecture materials.
This is the second course in the Python for Everybody specialization.  
The course is really structured for us.

Dr. Severance (Dr. Chuck) does an excellent job of making the concepts 
clear and understandable. 

Dr. Chuck has an unusual sense of humor, but I think most students will enjoy it as I have.
I am a medical student so I am very far away from programming but this course and the professor really prove that programming is for everyone with the simple and complete explaining of the topics. great job professor I am happy to learn from you and to the have the honor to take the certificate from you
As someone with hardware IT experience but NO coding/programming expieirence, I felt all the courses I have taken under Mr. Severance has been so beginner friendly and I have learned a lot. I never thought I would have this passion, these materials are so easy to...digest and I recommend it for anyone.
Dr Chuck is Amazing. In the beginning the programming assignments seem easy but as you progress through the weeks, the assignments get more interesting and challanging requiring you to remember the course material that you studied in the previous course. And Dr. Chuck's sense of humuor is also awesome.
I am taking this course to gain a knowledge base for my PhD. Great course that built on Dr. Severance's first intro course. The assignments were the right level of challenging without being frustrating and really helped me understand how lists, dictionaries, and tuples can be utilized to achieve tasks.
Prof. Charles is a very fascinating person and very enthusiastic and a true teacher who instills loads of confidence even in an ordinary student by explaining most difficult concepts in a very fun filled manner..Huge gratitude to Prof. Charles Severance, thanks a lot sir.. from the bottom of my heart..
I‘m so glad that i finished this course successfully，so many thanks to my dear lovely Dr.Charles.I like his teaching style,he makes it easy for students to understand everything,even a students without any programming experience like me. I highly recommend this course for you who want to learn Python.
Great course!!! By the end I felt like I really have solid grasp on low level programming and the basic programming concepts. Interesting exercises involving parsing through a text file that makes use of all these techniques. Extremely practical! Can't recommend this course enough. Definitely take it!
Awesome course, well taught, easy to understand and goes beyond just learning Python. The lectures on the people who created other languages and libraries are great. I've learned a lot and I'm hoping that Dr. Chuck keeps creating courses. He's simply amazing. That said, I'd love a class on algorithms.
I was an absolute beginner when i started the Python for Beginner course and now after Python Data Structure I feel like i can code easily in Python. I have gained a lot of confidence in coding because of this course. I want to Thank Dr. Chuck for guiding me through the whole python programing world.
Thanks a lot for this fantastic course. For someone who was totally new to programming in any computer language, I feel confident and really motivated to learn more of python and apply this gained knowledge to work as a data analyst. Thanks for all the effort you have put into the creation of course.
Truly enjoyed the course and Dr Severance's talks. However, I believe that more assignments would help me feel more confortable about "mastering" a topic before moving on to the next one. Even if the course does not have more exercises, pointing towards where they can be found would be highly useful.
This course was awesome. Even though I took previous course on python on other mooc platforms like edx, but I liked this course more than anyone else. And also the instructor Dr. Chuck did a very good job. He made this course engaging, funny, very easy. I did not how I completed this course so fast.
The second course in the specialization Python for Everybody was equally exciting as the first one. The course content is tastefully selected and the pace is perfect to catch up all the minute details. Dr. Chuck is a wonderful professor and has truly helped in making learning so easy and efficient.
Dr. Chuck is an amazing human being. I have been taught C and C++ in my university but still had zero confidence in coding even though my grades are amazing but this course is more than just learning to code and I'm grateful to this course for instilling in me that little bit of confidence to code.
I am not new to python. I've learnt already in college. But, lacks clarity in basic concepts. I strongly recommend this course which strengths you from scratch of problem solving using data structures. Now, I am pretty confident to solve problems in python. Special mention to Dr. Chuck (Instructor)
That is an excellent introduction to Python. Dr. Chuck explains everything very clearly. What is more, he is really inspiring which is great. Before this course I thought that programming is something very complicated which I cannot learn. But now it seems absolutely possible:) Thank you very much!
The teaching methodology of Professor Chuck is the main reason I was able to complete this course in 4 days only. He never lets my interest in python decrease and I am always eager to learn new things in Python and the pace set by him is ideal. For a week there is only one topic which helps a lot.
Good course for beginners. Easy exercises, well planned course. Most importantly, the course is based on a book. Learners can read the book and/or watch the video(s), that makes following this course easy. There is a room for improvement, though, a real life case study is missing in the syllabus.
I feel rather grateful to complete these courses and thank you for Dr.Church to use his sense of humor to add flavor for the python study. However, the assignments and the course content starts to be a little difficult to me and I need to review it again and again even though I have completed it.
It's an amazing course to do for any python beginner. The instructor has been very fantastic through out the course, his explanations are quite simple and easy to comprehend. one must opt this course if they are willing to step forward in python programming. Thanks everyone for this opportunity.
Dr. Chuck nails it again - this is the perfect follow-up to the 'Python for Everyone' course, as it builds on the groundwork laid there, to produce real-world useful ideas. This course is where it gets interesting.Big thanks to Dr. Chuck and the team at Michigan for putting this course together.
I already learned other programming languages in the past and have forgotten them (more than 10 years agor). This course is really good in refresh  what I know and adding more. It is a really consistent way how this course is structured. Python is really an amazing and easy programming language.
The more i am completing the courses under this specialization, the more i am feeling excited to complete rest of the courses. The teaching method of this instructor is awesome! Python is great and he is making it easier to catch.I would like to recommend everyone to take this course.Thank you.
it was a great course , i've learned many things after the basics , that i've never thought of it , also a bit challenging too but everything went so easy thanks to our instructor Dr. Chuck , without him i would  be so hard to do this on my own , so thank you so much for the support Dr.Chuck :)
The level of difficult in the course was just right. I was able to use the knowledge that i accumulated over the first Python for everyone course and was able to completed all projects without issue but not without thinking about the issue and was not too easy. Very excited to start the course.
This course provides crisp, to the point knowledge about various data structures in python, and provides relevant information and examples so that one knows when to use what data structure. The assignments are great to get started and neither too intimidating nor very easy. Highly recommend it!
This is an excellent course to understand Python data structures.  Charles Severance is clearly an expert of the subject and does an excellent job fostering understanding in students.  He explains concepts in a way that is very easy to understand for anyone, especially those new to programming.
It was fun. I am just really enjoyed. Now I have confidence is parse and extract data. Also I can play with data. The assignments were also exciting and tough enough to stimulate my mind. Special thanks to Dr. Chuck he made this very easy. And thanks to coursera for providing me financial aid.
Thanks so much for Supporting I just love the way You guys are Teaching because All the assignments I've done till now made me think out of the box and kept me busy for hours thinking about more thoughts and more solutions Thank you so much for This amazing Course and SupportThank you Dr.Chuck
I have completed the first two courses in the specialization "Python for Everybody". And now what keeps me with the same motivation and the same excitement as the beginning, is the unmatchable sense of humour of Dr.Chuck and the way he keeps everything straight to the point and understandable.
Great course.

Professor Severance makes things really clear and easy to understand.

The assignments are crucial for mastering the fundamentals of manipulating files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. They are worth spending time struggling with.

Overall, excellent lectures and course design.
A great introduction to Python.  Dr. Severance did a wonderful job explaining all of the topics in a way that was easy to understand and learn.  The exercises were the perfect level of difficulty - a little bit challenging, but completely possible given the things we learned in video lectures.
Really enjoyed this class a lot! I'm very proud of myself finishing all the 10 chapters and fully comprehend them within a short period of time, and you'll be able to do this FOR SURE!!! Easy to understand, and very motivational to accomplish every chapter with its assignments. Challenge now!
Very well structured course that takes you step by step through the concepts and gives you a clear understanding of the inner functioning of the code your write. I am sure this insight will be very useful when one gets to writing live code and this knowledge will help write more optimal code.
An excellent course. Would specifically recommend this course to the people who are novices in programming and who are new to python. This course will definitely help you appreciate the basics of python and some relevant use cases. A big thank you to Dr. Chuck for creating an excellent course
Its was an interesting course. I wanted to learn python from such a long time and thank you University of Michigan and Coursera for bringing the course to me. and thank you Prof. Severance for teaching me python in such a wonderful way. I m looking forward to taking similar Courses in future.
Thank you so much for this really engaging, intuitive and exciting course, Professor Chuck! I really enjoyed myself and it was definitely a great introduction to data structures! Recommended for beginners or whoever wants to revise their understanding of Python data structure fundamentals :)
The course is very well structured and fluid. So after learning the basics, this is the nice platform to dive into python a bit more. I love the teaching style of Dr. Chuck. He keeps things interesting while making us try and make mistakes and learn from them. It was great learning from him!
Professor Chuck has tons of enthusiasm for teaching in general and for teaching computer science. Professor Chuck makes the class fun and distills the information in an understandable format. I would highly  recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about programming in Python.
I heard that Python is a very powerful language, but things I have learnt in this course proves that Python is indeed an Elegant and powerful programming language.It was a fun and interesting learning experience, Assignments were challenging. Excellent explanation of concepts! I enjoyed it.
Excellent course and excellent instructor Dr. Chuck learning with fun . learned alot things in Python for Data Structures course do register and happy learning.Thank You Michigan University , Coursera and Class Central for providing us such a great platform for learning programming language
A great course on data structures to begin with as it includes all the essential details of the data structures and the instructor i.e. dr. chuck is very good and clears all the misconceptions within the lectures , the bonus of each chapter also gives knowledge about important basic things.
I took this course as part of the Python for Everybody Specialization in Coursera, and is the second course for that class, I loved the way every single topic is given, also the reading material is really complete, so if you combine both (reading and videos) you will reallz enjoy the course
I liked the course and how the content is divided into chunks, making learning easier and having immediate feedback before it is too late.  I would just add some more optional assignments to hone in the concepts.  I also enjoyed very much the bonus interviews, they give life to the subject!
Dr Chuck is great at what he does, and truly enjoys his work. This makes a great difference as a student. This is a solid introduction to Python's DataStructures and i really enjoyed the class. Quizzes and assignments were very organised and made sure I didn't miss anything from the class.
The python data structure is really great. Dr. Chuck is really great. He is one of the best instructors I met. The course materials are perfect lectures, assignments, quiz everything is great. It is good for everyone as a beginner and for anyone who wants to deepen their skills in python.
Great course to learn about python data structures in file, string, list, dictionary and tuples. It start from solving a problem with string, then move on to list, dict and tuple gradually by revisiting the same problem again and how to use the more advanced method we learn along the way.
Love this course and the textbook that it uses. The videos really tie in the textbook so that pretty much everything you might have questions about is explained and worked through. It has made learning python3 easier than I thought it would be for someone with no programming experience!!
This is the best thing that I have ever done. I said this in the review of the first course and again I am saying this. This is only because of Dr. Charles. He is a brilliant teacher and also a brilliant person. If you really want to learn python just go for it. One of the best courses.
The Python Data Structures course is a very good one. The material is presented in structured manner. The the way  Dr Charles Severance presented the theory is brilliant. I highly recommend this course for Python beginners or who was not successful with other Python courses (as myself).
Python data structures is a really helpful class to learn the basics of python and apply them in real world. 
This course definitely elevated my interest in python and I would find ways to use it at my work. 
This course also encouraged me to learn more of python by taking more courses.
I first took this class just as some kind of quick refresher of basic python... but I got totally hook with this second course!I really like the practical orientation of that specialization so far. It's sometime a bit cheesy but it's such a well design MOOC. I definitively recommend it!
Really amazing course. Charles Severance is a wonderful teacher and the exercises really help to consolidate the material that he teaches. Coding initially seemed like an intimidating task, and now I feel proficient at the basics and ready to continue writing scripts and learning more.
Awesome explanation by the instructor. The method with he teaches will surely help the beginners to grasp any concept easily.  However, having known a little python, i think there should be videos regarding exactly how the data structures are laid into the memory. Overall its perfect!
I spent more time on this course than the getting start with python course. Even though I can finish the quits and assignments after watching the videos, I highly recommend the book for this course. There are some tips that are not mentioned in the videos, but they are very practical.
I think this is a marvelous course for people from grassland as me to learn Python and really feel being able to use it as a tool instead of just another lecture completed. I would recommend this course to any of my friend who attempt to join the Data Scientist world. Thank you Chuck!
The lecture is quite awesome and interesting to complete the course; Course structure helps anyone to understand why we need to do that, what to be done, how can be made and most important where can be utilized. Thanks, Mr Charles Russell Severance and his team for an amazing course.
Dr. Chuck is a great instructor, and the course format pairs lecture and practice very well to foster actual learning and retention of the material. I started several Python courses on different platforms to decide which platform to continue with, and this was BY FAR the best course.
I can not believe how much I've learned and how comfortable I feel.  Getting better all the time.  Dr. Chuck's courses are wonderful and with some good self-study on top of the course, you'll be doing some pretty cool stuff in no time.  Looking forward to continuing on this path.  :)
It was a good crash course on python programming, the professor teaches from basic level with step by step manner and hand-on practice and the assignments revise the learned concepts. It would be very helpful in my future.  I would like to learn a further part of python programming.
The Instructor is really good.It's really a course for beginners.The way Dr. Charles delivers his lectures is fascinating.He explains things in a more understandable way for people with non-cs backgrounds.In fact,even if you're from cs background,you'll find the courses very helpful
Another excellent intro course for Python novices taught by a wonderful professor in Dr. Chuck. I look forward to continuing in the Python for Everybody specialization and highly encourage anyone at all interested in Python or programming in general to check out Dr. Chuck's courses.
This class was great! So far the whole series has been wonderful. It moves at a great pace and the assignments are in manageable chunks to allow you to really learn each section.  I have enjoyed these courses over my in class programming courses I took at Michigan while I was there.
It was a great experience with this course and the instructor was very much  interesting i enjoyed attending videos with him .It was a course which will provide you the best thing in less time and the assignments are also very good,it was quite tough but i enjoyed while solving it.
Not too much, not too little. To me, I thought this course was going to be mainly a review. However, I learned much more than I expected in the 3 days it took me to complete. For those who understand programming but don't understand Python, this course should be very quick for you.
It was not really easy for me to finish these courses in the busy schedules but I did find some feeling on the computer language by this course. Thank you for your dedication to the world and hopefully I can be a part of your journey sometime in the future. I am from S.Korea btw :)
Professor is very passionate about the course. Good class to go along with Python for everybody, class is taught in a very understandable way with good examples. the professor also works through code examples in a very understandable way.  one of the best online courses ive taken!
This is an excellent course, well designed with practical assignments and covers a lot of ground in a short period of time. with an excellent professsor and mentoring staff. Special kudos to Tamara Brunnock for her depth of knowledge, prompt response, teaching skill and patience .
It's was amazing to learn data structure in python from sir charles, the way course is design that makes me more interested and the bonus video keeps you entertaining throughout the course. i should say its worth taking this course. I learned a lot and I wish I could sir charles.
Excellent course to learn Python data structure concepts and their practical usage. I have bought many books on Python programming. However this course helped me to gain the best understanding of Python list, dictionary and tuple and differences between them. Thank you very much.
Very good course to understand about the data structures in Python. Supported by nice quiz and thought provoking assignments. Really enjoyed the course and proud of myself in completing this course successfully. Would strongly recommend this course to aspiring Python programmers.
I completed this course in trhee days, because I'm not working now, and I have many time in a day, I'm a programmer in different programing languages, but  I need to update my knowledge because in my last job was not related in the IT area and I spent 5 years, so I needed update
This course helps to learn the basics of Python in such an adorable I can't elaborate. Very cool delivery by Dr. Charles. Thank you to all who are behind this. I would highly recommend this course who have just started coding and want to clear their basics this course is great.
Wonderful course, Dr. Chuck is an articulate, passionate and playful teacher that truly loves what he does. He embraces his geeky side with complete confidence in an almost contagious manner. I truly enjoyed the last two courses with Dr. Chuck and can't wait for the next two :)
Getting harder than the first class in python, a good course for first learner to get further python knowledge.Doctor Severance is a vary qualified and humorous teacher, puts efforts into this courses.If you have time, you can go through material efficiently and get the credit.
This is a great course with all the core essentials that are necessary for actually applying code to something useful. The only thing I would say could make this course better would be including a hacker edition to the problem sets that would help serve to deepen understanding.
Another useful course made easy to understand by professor Charles Severance. Important fundamentals that will prepare you for future programming courses. I highly recommend continuing with this specialization before going onto more advanced topics, certifications, or degrees.
This course is very challenging, but I am enjoying the process of learning this material. Sometimes I feel it is overwhelming, but researching other videos on YouTube really helps me out sometimes. I am so proud of what I have accomplished thus far! I can't wait to keep going!
This was the most interesting course that I have taken. I had learnt so many things and trust me Dr. Chuck is the best teacher in the world. I loved that course and my learning has been increased after taking this course. Thank you so much Chuck sir. I would like to meet you.
Excellent course that provides basic knowledge about data structures. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who has no programming experience and want to learn Python. Dr. Chuck is great teacher who has the ability to teach hard concept in an interesting and easy manner.
Very productive way to learn how to get data from not structured sources.
As as second course I learned how to get important data from not structured source of information, so far I Think I already have the knowledge to start developing my own tools for boost my productivity.
The pace set by Prof. Chuck is perfect for each topic as the course progresses.  This is an extremely well designed and accessible method of learning Python.  The ability to go at one's own speed as time permits is invaluable.  I'm excited to keep going in the specialization.
I completed the second course of the 5-course specialization! I can do more! I really like HP and the graduation ceremony part. I've never been to an American style graduation ceremony before. This is my first time! Thank you Dr. Severance for providing this wonderful course.
Concepts were new to me and required interest as well as persistence to complete. Dr. Chuck's beautifully organised lectures and the way he taught certainly helped me become better at the concepts day by day and I'm no longer afraid of computer science! I love Python! Sssss!
very good course with clear explanation, examples, and guidance, thank you very much for the lesson so now i would be able to at least doing a code in python as I never touch it before.. hopefully I could continue my study in this specialization course until the last course.
Best in class course, materials and other stuff, Dr.Chuck is really a man of intellect and fun, which makes his lectures even more interactive and motivating. These types of teachers is of what world need right now. Great work, to all those involved in making of this course.
It was a fantastic course. I learned a lot from it. After completing the first course in this specialization, all the concepts were cleared and hence, part 2 was easy to understand. Charles Severance sir is an awesome teacher who explains the concepts very clearly. Cheers !!
The course was very well designed in it's approach to teaching data structures and subsequently putting them to use in such a way that you would exert yourself in thinking how to solve problems, but at the same time the material you covered would still prove to be helpful.
One can enjoy by learning in this course. When I started this specialization I knew nothing about programming but now I am can say that I am better than beginner and by continuing this specialization I may not be an Expert but I am sure that I reach the Intermediate stage.
During the previous course, I wished it was a little more challenging but this course was perfect in my opinion. I do wish number of exercises was more so we get more practice. But other than that, Dr. Chuck is a great instructor and his explanation works very well for me.
This course is really interesting and engaging . It will make you test your understanding about the course in a deeper way. Keep your Ears open and concentrate on the assignments. You will fail, hit hard but you will definitely come back with flying colors. Thanks Dr Chuck
Dr Chuck has been nice, crisp and playful and was able to make me understand every topic, he is the best a professor can be. I personally would recommend anyone interested for this can take this up. It'll surely help. Looking forward to meeting him soon in the next course.
This course enhances and develops your data structures skills and knowledge in python programming language. Dr. Chugg is the best mentor to teach this course and he makes every concepts and problems to understand in a very creative way. I love his methodology of teaching.
Fantastic course. Dr. Chuck is an outstanding instructor, humorous, engaging, easy to follow and learn from. I audited the course, but have decided the following courses in the specialization are worth paying for, so I've signed on for the remainder of the specialization.
Awesome second course from Chuck. He explains the material well and provides a great foundation in Python and coding. The mentors are responsive and helpful when you have questions, and the exercises are a good level of challenge but not so difficult they are frustrating.
this course is very interesting as Dr. Chuck is very good at teaching. The instruction provided in this course are very clear and anyone who can learn coding by this course. But the course has more readable content for you to take notes and reading it may take more time.
The professor is really great. He teaches this course so clearly and at the right pace. I had no understanding of programming other than the first course in the specialization and this class taught me so much. It made me feel confident to pursue more programming classes!
Loved this course! Dr. Chuck is a very friendly instructor and he explained the basics of python data structure beautifully, not to mention the bonus videos which are quite motivating too! If you want to peek into python data structure basics, this is the course for you.
It is a very good experience of attending the course. I missed the earlier course of Python data structures but the topics were explained so nicely that I understood all. Professor Charles gave a very deep insight into the data structures in Python. I have learned a lot.
Dr Chuck puts in a lot of effort into the course. So thanks to him. I highly recommend reading the textbook and doing the exercises in it - in addition to the course work on Coursera. There's a lot of supplementary material for the course online as well if you are stuck.
I completely enjoyed this course and highly recommend it. Dr Chuck does a great job. The lectures are easy to follow. I liked the exercises which have a good balance between being easy enough to succeed at the same time making one to think carefully to find the solution.
Great course! Finished it in 2 days. Lots of trial and error. Really enjoy Dr. Chuck's humor and excellent explanations. Also, thank you very much for providing the option to take this course free of charge. Looking forward to the next course in the series, thanks again!
An awesome course with a rich valuable contents, what ever your level in Python now it, definitely it will take you to the next level. Also, the instructor Dr. Charles is very very simple, clear, funny and a professional teacher you will enjoyed his straight simple way.
After completing this course, I have become a big fan of this instructor. He taught us so nicely and in a very scientific way. The lectures weren't boring at all. All topics were easily and elaborately explained. I am eager to enroll in courses with the same instructor.
I have the same feedback as the previous course in this specialization.  Great videos, easy to follow, and quick to understand.  I liked how the programming assignments keep building on one another.  Dr. Chuck does a great job explaining the material.  Highly recommend.
It is really important course for beginners who are willing to work on python., This Course explains the lists, dictionaries, tuples  in a very understanding way. Assignments are also good. I recommend this course mandatory for people studying python for the first time.
Another excellent course in this series!  I find that I am completing assignments quicker and with less help needed which leads me to believe I'm actually learning!  Great pace and good info...highly recommended for beginners or those who want to learn another language.
This course is exceptional and I started to love Dr. Chuck just because of his cool gestures in delivering concepts and his good heart in sharing experiences in the aim of guiding us to a brighter future. He is by far the greatest mentor I have seen on online platforms
This course was an excellent experience for me! I learned a lot about the Data Structures in Python, which I'm sure will be very useful for my career. I highly recommend it for people who wants to get started in programming and/or want to get to know more about Python!
If you don't have any programming skills or you just want to learn python,then this course is the best for you. The way Chuck teaches you will fall in love with python and want to take more of the courses in this specialization. Thank you chuck for this awesome course.
This course was very well taught, and it helped me to understand how to use and manipulate all kinds of different data structures to solve a problem. The professor's explanation made the Python concepts very easy to learn and understand. I enjoyed the course immensely.
I like the 4-C and 4-P principles that you talked about 4-C: Choice, Commitment, Connections, Completion 4-P: Passion, Persistence, Purpose, and PlayfulnessThis is just the beginning of a number of wonderful courses. I seriously loved the exercises it's quite engaging.
There is no substitute for a great learning website and Coursera is one of them.   You are extra special Charles severance, sir.   Just a note to say you’re extra-ordinary Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller because you create a great website for us especially for ANAND KUMAR.
Excellent course for beginners (after taking the first Python course) and for people with some programming experience who want a review or a useful reference guide.I think there's a typo in the code for deleting punctuation in Chapter 9's advanced text parsing section.
Dr Charles Sevenrance really made the good point of the materials. This class is related to the fundamental principle of data structure and the lecturer really made it easy to understand. Perfect course for beginners. Thank you Dr Charles Severance, thank you Coursera!
Dr. Chuck is an amazing teacher. he will help u understand the every bit of it and it doesn't really matters whether u r a technical guy or not, cause this course will help building u r programming skills from scratch. thank you coursera and Dr. Chuck for this Course.
You should save your programs on your desktop because once you complete this course in the specialization you'll no longer be able to access your completed assignments for future assignments. Just a tip. I was dumb and didn't backup my work. Learn from my mistake....
this is very good course and able to learn new things about data structures in python .I would like to request you to give responses for me in discussion forum and help me in discussion forum how to create threads and discuss. Thankyou for Charles sir and instructor
Very strong course on data structures. The prof teaches you the deeper understanding behind data structures and not just "a list is a bunch of variables". And a deeper more meaningful understanding of the concepts that build Python ultimately makes you a better dev.
good,nice and clear explanations on the topics of python and i like the practice excercises  as they are some what more near to real  world tasks and i would encourage you to  give more and more new assignments for students to improve their thinking abilitythank you
I have taken this course and the teacher is amazing , the way he interacts and tells stories , its just amazing. Mr Charles have a great knowledge and is very fun to listen to .The course is very well covered and explained and now i am learning python till the end .
Dr. Chuck, is the best.  He is very brilliant, cool, outgoing, and unlike many other people who are much less credentialed, he is unpretentious.  I am looking forward to taking my courses and hope to meet this great man and role model some day.  Thank you Dr. Chuck!
This is a great course. I've learned a lot and Professor Severence is very knowledgeable. I have started applying my new found knowledge at work, writing basic scripts to assist in some of the data cleaning tasks I do. I would highly recommend this course to others.
The Instructor was amazing. I find myself thorough with everything he taught, despite having to finish the course much earlier than expected. Was a unique and eventful learning experience, and felt a connect with the instructor, thanks to those fun bonus videos! (:
I would say it is a splendid way to know the functionality and possible examples of applications of python in real life. This course motivates me to proceed further to see what is next in bucket. I have never been enthusiastic to learn programming the way I am now.
This is one of the best course I have taken in Coursera. Though the assignments are of "hard difficulty" for  beginner like me, I still managed it to finish 27 days ahead of my schedule. It is because i get to enjoy learning that I became committed in finishing it.
Very good conclusion to learning the fundamentals of Python, after the first class. I've already been programming in Python for awhile, but there was some basics I had missed, which was extremely helpful for me to learn about. I'm very excited for the next classes!
Loved this course and Dr. Chuck is my favorite instructor. His way of teaching was definitely a vital motivation for taking up this course. Learnt many new concepts which are actually useful for my work life. Python is a really easy and smart language I would say.
This is the second course I have taken from this series and with Prof Dr. Chuck and I loved it as much as the first one! I had (have) no prior experience with Python but Dr. Chuck makes the lectures so interactive and understandable that even I was able to follow.
I started Python for Everybody five days ago., and I've already completed my second course. I've spent years trying to teach myself programming languages. This course is organized so well that students can build on simple concepts to produce more complex programs.
Dr charles explained this course in the simplest way possible. Also his little funny comments and light-hearted jokes made all the difference as it kept the class engaging giving the student a chuckle or two every couple of minutes. Great teacher and great course!
I just passed the first course "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) " a month ago and was good, so I started "Python Data Structures" and I gotta say this course is totally different and definitely practical. Well done Coursera it was nice job.
Thank you Dr. Severance. Your course has been very helpful. I also very much appreciated the efforts of teaching assistants, whose contributions in the forum have been very helpful. The step-by-step course design and those worked exercise videos also helped a lot.
The first steps towards functional utility with the Python programming language; this course will give a solid foundation in the practical applications of how to structure information within Python for easy of use, readability, debugging and efficient programming.
I missed data sets as a data structure. I am still not sure how to handle data sets in Python and if it is even possible but I am assuming it is (also looking at the coming classes). A word on data sets even if it is just: It exists and we will deal with it later.
great experience with this course and learned a lot about data structure using python. it is a easy to understand course and covers every basics of tuple, list, dictionary, string, files and all. Best for beginners, and again i had learned a lot from this course.
Dr.Chuck is an amazing instructor, not only shares his professional knowledge of Python but also his meeting with classmates and life during the classes. If you take the course, you will definitely learn a lot from the content of classes, the assignments as well.
It is really helpful course .I love the way Dr. Chunk teaches.Impressive Job ! Everyone has to learn it and master it,and why not ? If elegant way of teaching is present for us ! Thank you Dr.Chunk for clear my concepts regarding this data structures of Python :)
Great course on the basics of Python data structures.  My understanding of the various type of data structures has improved after completing this program. Some key takes away are understanding the inter-link between them and how to apply them to do data analysis.
You keep learning by the same and remarkable method: easy-going video lectures with quizzes and deliverables at the end of each week. Additionally, certain extra videos enables you to have a more open vision of the Python and Programming Community. I, definitely,
Really well explained course! I did have to watch the chapters about Lists and Dictionaries twice to actually get it down (which was recommended at the start of the videos), but I have a much better understanding than any other tutorials that I have taken before.
This course is awesome. I was learning from different resources about data structure, but i was not understanding why i need to learn those. This course practically shows what to do with data structure and what is the relation between  strings, tuples, list etc.
this has given me more motive to continue learning python for the time being. I really like the way the course is presented and the coding assignments really ge your head working which is very much fun. thanks professor Chuck and team for your support and effort
This course is very well structured and One needs to practice after taking each week. I had some beforehand knowledge regarding the course. So, The Course is very interesting and I would recommend all the beginners who have completed the basics of python course.
This course is excellent. Very intuitively designed conceptual lectures on basic aspects of list, dictionary, tuple and more. Excellent interviews with designers and developers of various programming languages. Fun videos and practical insights on future career.
This course gives a brief introduction on python data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries and also about the file accessing capability i.e to read from  a file and write the data into a file.  I recommend this course for everyone to take up this course.
its a really interesting course. I learned so many concepts easily like lists, dictionary manipulation of files. different functions  for example : .sort(), .split(), .startswith() etc.and the assignments were so amazing. I am really to happy learn this course.
Really gets into the meat and potatoes of Python.  I enjoyed how the instructor has set it up to allow for people with experience in other languages to move quickly into areas where Python differs and work on those, beyond what is needed to complete the module.
After Python Data Structures course, as  the second course of this series (By Dr. Chuck), you can commence your path in programming and develop your knowledge in this area.I love Dr. Chuck's teaching method and his really positive inspiring vibe!Don't miss it!
Dr.Chuck is an amazing instructor who know how to convert the abstract ideas into concrete examples ! I recommend sincerely this beginner course! Additionally he puts up so many interviews of creators of other languages, and that boosts confidence in learning.
It was a great course, because they started from scratch which makes it easier for a person who doesnt even know a single language. In the process of learning python, because of Dr. Chuck, I was able to understand C language also better then what i had learnt.
This is an excellent course for someone who don't know much about Python. The video is great, and proper assignments. If there has to be some suggestions, I would suggest to have some more exercise in the course to practically improve Python programming skill.
Wonderful teaching methods! I've taken a good number of online courses (Udacity, Youtubers etc) and this course is BY FAR the best I've taken. I can tell the professor's affinity for not just computer science, but for TEACHING... which makes a huge difference.
Wonderfully paced and explained by Dr Chuck. Very clear examples which made understanding the Python collections and data structures very easy. And I was able to complete all my assignments correctly in the first try itself !!! Hurrraay... :)Thanks Dr Chuck...
Useful as a refreshing course to some of the data manipulation method in python. Homework are written to apply the concepts covered in lecture. Some of the quiz problems are really testing your understanding of a certain terms and aspects of python programming
This course gives introduction to Files handing in python also topics related to data collections i.e.(lists, dictionary and tuples). The course is very well designed and its been fun to complete this course as well as gain so much knowledge at the same time.
Awesome instructor! He really knows how to teach. Every lesson was a pleasure and it was broken down in such a way that it was easy to understand and highly entertaining. I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn the Python programming language.
The course is very well structured and covers all the major topics.I would specifically like to thank Dr. Charles Severance for creating and explaining each and every aspect of Python Data Structures with such ease that makes me feel confident to use Python.
A interesting course in the specialization Python for Everybody (total of 5 courses). The instructor is well equipped with the adequate resources and knowledge essential for making the learners understand the content. The assignments are equally challenging.
Getting taught by the high end professor is always something special and additionally understanding the efforts of students to understand programming is also added to the syllabus that a person going through this course will carved fully the power of Python.
Very nice course. The course structure is very well thought and organized well. Above all, the tutor creates great interest in the topic and explains very clearly. you need not refer any books or notes ; tutor class is just enough to understand the concepts.
the course was so important to me , it helps me a lot with python programing ,data structure and problem solvingi want to thank dr chuck for helping me to increase my skills thank you so much thanks coursera for making it easy to learn online ,love you all:)
Very understandable and interesting course, as well as the explaining structure. I very much recommend this course (as the rest of them from the batch) for anyone who is looking to learn programming in python or get basic knowledge in programming in general.
Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher who provides a well structured course and effectively uses multiple tools (book, slides, videos, discussion boards, encouragement/positive nudges, and more) to help you learn how to use python.  I highly recommend this course
Really liked this course.  I did need a tutor to help me through it and for the assignment problems.  However, Dr. Chuck does a good job of illustrating the main points and addressing the key issues behind data structures of Python.Thanks so much, Dr. Chuck.
Great overview of data structures. I'd learned Data Structures in Java many years ago, so I already knew the basics, but Chuck's understanding and explanations of the core concepts in this course felt really natural to grasp. Thanks for sharing and teaching!
This course was great.I learned a lot about data structures in Python particularly the FOR and WHILE loop since it is used in other languages.If you don't have any programing background (like me) this class or specialization is a great place to learn Python.
A Wonderful course, You will learn the basics of how to use python data structures and also some tips and tricks on how to use them. Recommended course for all beginners and this course is better than Python courses in edx and also other python courses here.
Great Course ! Absolutely covers Python Data Structure, it is really helpful for me. If you want to master on python data structure you can take this course. All the quiz and assignments are really amazing. I am really thankful to the professor Dr-Chuck :) .
at the very beginning i have not that much of confident but because of Dr. Chuck lecture and explanation my confident increased . the way he explain and make fun is really something different . this tutorial is full of informatics as well as implementable .
I'm learning my second programming language and its a treat to listen to Dr. Chuck. I love that he uses practical examples to explain simple concepts. I feel very confident about the stuff I learnt in this course and I would recommend this course to anyone.
I Would like to recommend this course to anyone who is interested in computer programming.It was a really great experience for me Dr.Chuck is a great teacher I would like to thank courser and University of michigan for giving me an opportunity in this class
I t was really nice experience. I learned about data structures in python and how to implement the same . Instructor was really good in explaining all details of python data structures. It was really good experience. Would recommend this course to everyone.
Great course! Dr Charles is amazing. The course is really step forward for every programmer. Not only with the class explanation, but with all the amazing interviews and the advices provided by Dr Charles. Thanks a lot for such an amazing programming course
Today, I have completed my Python Data Structures Course. This is a great course about Python Data Structures (List, Dictionary, Tuple). I highly appreciate my teacher, Dr. Charles Russell Severance, and Coursera. I wish my best to my teacher and Coursera.
Learning is fun, is truly proved by Dr. Chuck. Thank you once again for teaching so nicely with the right pace. This has given me a good start to explore more about Python, and I'm surely learning the next course and excited to dive into the sea of Python.
Prof Charles has a great way of making learning fun. With good analogies, bonus interactive sessions with people related to computer industry and comprehensive lectures to drive the point home, this course is a treat to starters to nail their fundamentals.
enjoyable course, homework getting trickier but worked videos very helpful. also https://stackoverflow.com/ for reference when your mistakes are too elementary for Charles' videos. Starting to now see some actual real world uses of writing simple programs.
Great course overall. I'd say that the assignments are challenging but are completely doable given what the professor covers in the week's lecture and reading assignments. The book is a great help and the lectures are easily to understand and follow along.
I really loved this course i was so hooked up that i wanted to do it in one go, this course is really amazing thanks to prof Chuck , sir you are really amazing and i hope i can personally meet you some day to thank you for this great piece of work. Thanks
Easy to learn! Easy to understand videos with an excellent mentor. There are open group discussions and also it's easy to ask for help from the mentor if I did not understand something. Very recommended for beginners. Really help me with my work progress,
Great course and foundation for building ever more complex Python applications. Charles Severance is doing a great job at walking you through the most basic concepts and build on top of them to create virtually any Python applications. Highly recommended.
I was scared of programming in general. In the past, I took couple of course about intoduction to programming and C language. Nevertheless,  I wasn't able to write/read code. After this course, I feel much more confident and optimistic. Thanks Dr. Chuck!
I really loved this course, I recommend it for everyone. simple and easy to understand and fathom. I hope you like it too. I hoped it was longer because I really enjoyed it. dr shuck is a great instructor.  enjoy it guys and have a great learning journey
It was exciting to learn data structure with python which gives me knowledge about coding and how is to execute a program ,how to code basically after completion of course i am very happy and hope this knowledge will helpful in coming projects.thank you!
I enjoyed this course and as a matter of fact I enjoyed this course because the teacher was so good in explaining stuff and the best part was his humor. Always, I learned a lot in this course and looking forward to the next course on python by Dr. Chuck.
I totally enjoyed this course and would really like to convey my special thanks to Dr. Severance for making the lecture and the entire learning process so enjoyable and interesting. I look forward to pursuing further lessons on the same. Thank you again.
Brilliant instructors and a great progression from the 'Python for Everybody' Course. By the end of this course you will really start to understand the power of python, especially when combined with other technologies that are introduced in later courses
I find this course to be an excellent introduction to the data structures in python. The examples and metaphors used by Dr.Chuck are lucid and easy to understand. I find Dr.Chucks passion and encouragement served as a motivation to complete this course !
Best ever course of coding i am have with this professor. It's the best Data structure course for python. If you are reading to conforming that it good or not. Then i would like to give you green flag from my side it's the best course for the beginners.
This Course provided an in-depth insight into the core concepts such as Data Structures and File Handling issues in Python. I learnt a lot from this course and the instructor was too good. I wish to pursue more courses with the instructor in the future.
The class is well paced for the busy individual, with concise lesson plans and short but effective programming assignments. Professor Severance is lively during the lectures so it's easy to keep focused on the material also. Great instruction and class.
Fantastic follow up (part 2) course to the Programming for everybody. The way the professor explains all the concepts (lists, dictionaries, tuples etc) is wonderful and very easy for anyone to grasp, beginners included.Thank you for the solved examples!
Nice course for those students who are not experienced in programming and want to understand the fundamentals not only python, but programming itself. If you are experienced one, you would better taking more advance course. Teaching is extremely clear.
Gosh I guess a lot of new stuff has happened since I wrote my first BASIC program back in 1980, now I am learning Python and I am having so much fun as I had before. ( am  I getting younger in the process? ) Thank you Coursera and thank you Dr. Chuck !
This course started with the very basics and taught me how to develop my coding knowledge. A few of the assignments very a little challenging but the level of difficulty was just perfect. I would love to continue in this series of python for everybody
I'm really impressed and kind of obsessed with python. I don't know if I will find Dr. Chuk in the upcoming course. But I wish to meet him personally and thank him for igniting the fire in me . Thanks coursera,thanks university of Michigan . Take love
I'm a big fan of Dr. Chuck and his teaching method.  The process of integrating the book (Python for Everybody, the video lectures, and the assignments, really helps ingrain the material.  I would strongly recommend this class for beginners in Python.
I know java before this study of python so I just finish the course one and two in a day. I would say that the explanation is extremely clear and important points are stressed according to their weight. The instructor is cordial and sincere. I like it
I really enjoyed this class, it was just the right amount of challenge for someone renewing their background in programming.  Charles presented the chapters in a way that was easy to understand.  I'm looking forward to the next course in this series.
I'm really enjoying learn programming. And I really assure now that I have choose the best for my need language. Actually, i'm developing a little business, and I can't wait until I have a good understanding of all of this: so many things would I do.
In order your programs do what you need, you have to learn how to organize the data in the best possible way.This course gives you the necessary tools so you learn what is the best way to use data in your programs.Easy to learn and best easy to apply
I think that courses in Coursera are the best in the world. I loved the course "Python for Everybody" and Dr. Chuck...# and some thanks :while True:                                                                 print("Thank you Very much Coursera)
This is the first class I have attended in this format and wondered how  effective it would be.The instructor was very knowlegeable and provided a wealth of information about current version. I would definelty recommend coursera to others.Thank you.
I am glad to participate this course. It was full of fun when i attended the lecture and the way Professor Charles gave the lecture was quite enjoyable and easy to learn . Hopefully i will do more courses under Dr. Charles Severence regarding Python
Dr. Chuck introduces the various data structures that are key for fundamental understanding of Python programming. In this course, you will begin to use the knowledge of these data structures (and the information in the intro to Python course) to be
Easy to understand, very friendly to new-coders. And I like the exercises, you need to use all you have learned in this course to complete the exercise, which is good because it allows you to review the course while doing it, could be harder though.
The instructor is a GOD. Never has anyone explained a programming language in such an easy to learn manner. Decent exercises overall. The course felt pretty easy. Please suggest some other materials that can help us learn data structures thoroughly.
really amazing course , no more staring at the screen not knowing what to do . Solution came natural to me , !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THANKS DR.CHUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is one of the best course i ever did. Now Dr. Charles is my favorite instructor. I really learned lot of new thing. The syllabus is well planned and in perfect order. I am so glad for learning python from Dr Charles sir. Thank you so much sir.
Second course of the Python series i take.The teacher explains very well all te topics covered and the questionnaries and exercises help to consolidate the agenda.Highly recommended for all students interested in learning data structures in Python.
Best course with best instructor so far in my journey of learning. I really appreciate the way Dr Chuck inspires and teaches. He is really one of the outstanding instructors we have. My sincere thanks to Sir, for such a wonderful word class effort.
Sorry for the really, really late review, but I have to add since it was such a good experience. I had a great time taking this course and really liked meeting other students and the professor in a face to face Office Hours in NYC. Thanks Dr Chuck!
I have one word : Fantastic...!

The course structure is carefully designed. Assignments are not too 
much, not too less. The way they comprehend the lectures of all the 
previous weeks is amazing.I would definitely suggest the course to my 
peers.
I personally found Doctor Chuck's thorough approach to be very beginner-friendly. This is an absolute gem of a course for the budding programmers out there who want an insight into the data structures of Python like Lists, Dictionaries and tuples.
It was amazing to learn under your guidance. In the 1st chapter of this course when i saw the dictionary program i was sort of scared that it would be difficult but when it came on 9th chapter i was surprised that i understood it. Thanks a lot sir
Dr. Charles .. a great person, loves teaching technical stuff in 
innovative way. Thank you sir for your Amazing presentation. Can do lot 
more things in python now :) .. Hats off to you ..and your skills. and yeah like those bonus videos toooo ;)
Great Dr. Chuck! All incredibly explained, for me it may be more difficult because I come from a totally different area and profession, and I didn't have much notion about this. Each concept is perfectly explained. I wish I had found you before =)
cutting edge, updated knowledge!! Best instructor and great material. Teaching pace is justifiable and adaptable. Thank you for the course!! I will recommend this course to ayone who wants to learn python conceptually and build the logical base!!
Most likely the best track of courses out there, if you want to get into programming from scratch. An inspiring teacher with a very very high quality material. And you really should not ignore the book, it has a beautiful collection of exercises.
this is amazing course on data structures.Although it is quite slow but after this course you can code using data structures without any doubt.Instructor of this course  Dr.chuck makes special bond with students with his videos and communications
Now I can write at least 25 lines of python code...learning python Data Structures is easy with this course. Dr.Chuck takes you from basic of python collections such as list,dictionary,tuples to advanced level, learning is joy with such contents.
I'm a graduate student studying immunology, I have to go through large data sets and am taking this course to help with data analysis. At the end of this section, I genuinely feel as if I can now attempt to start diving into the data with python.
Thank you all for allowing me to take part in this course. I have been spending sleepless nights waiting for this moment. This is my first week and having completed Getting Started With Python, I am quite optimistic that I will enjoy this course.
An cant emphasize enough how important has been to learn step by step. When you try to read a code from somebody else, a complex one, if you know the basics structures, you can understand it line by line, otherwise you get confused in the middle.
Another excellent course taught by Dr. Chuck. The material is presented in a very logical order where each class builds on the previous class and deepens your knowledge at a comfortable yet challenging pace. Looking forward to completing the next
This professor is the best. He will mentor you and help you understand the material and, what is more important, even though the material is not easy, grading is NOT a learning experience, as it should be, but a fair assessment of your learning.
This course is easy to understand and a nice introductory to python. The way how the instructor presented the topics are very nice and simple. The activities are constructed in a way that you will apply whatever you have learned in the lectures.
An excellent course for building a foundation in the language. Everything explained perfectly . The assignments are amazingly crafted in that they necessitate you to apply each and every concept learned and cannot circumvent around it and cheat.
Dr. Chuck has really built this course to teach Python to everybody. Coupled with  office hours and awesome interviews with inventors and people whose passion have led to advances in Information Technologies is mind blowing. Thank you Dr. Chuck.
Dr.Chuck guided all through the course work, I am happy that I can write code and put it syntactically right. Can identify what exactly is syntactical error and this course work really helped me to get a grip on coding the logic.Thank you,Sindhu
I found this very challenging. I picked this course up as a hobby, but really needed to focus to remember the grammar for coding. Useful, I'm sure it will get easier if I get a chance to apply the lessons. Feels like there is much more to learn.
First i want to thanks professor chunck for making everything very easy to understand. This course is very very useful for beginners. This course provides lots of knowledge about python basic data structure (list, dictionaries,tuple and files).
it taught me some of the basic data structures in python , however I would like to suggest Prof. Severence to also include another important data structure that I have found very useful, that data structure is "deque" from the collection class.
An excellent course for beginners to be familiar with not just python itself, but with the overall landscape of computer programming. Absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to any new learners looking for a great resource to learn python.
In my opinion, this is one of the best courses in the world.Thank you so much Dr. Chuck for your outstanding knowledge and behavior.I learnt a lot of things from you.thank you so much dear Coursera for letting me being in a part of this course
It is the second course I'm taking with Dr. Chuck at this Python specialization and I'm truly amazed! A great course for any beginner in programming and Dr. Chuck does a great job explaining the concepts that we can implement in the exercises.
A wonderful course. I had an overall idea of python and was using it with a lot of help from the internet. This course gave me a streamlined understanding of the data structures that are available to for use. A very good course for a beginner.
Precision, Balance and Impact - All the three elements are very well balanced in this course - and addresses the aspects for experienced and non experienced programmers. The Quizzes and the Assignments add a lot of value to the course content.
This has been very helpful in my learning a new programming language since Dr. Severance provides detailed information and background information necessary to allow me to have a better understanding of each topic for Python. Thank you so much!
was quite interesting to learn, it is beginner-friendly and if you have the basics from the first course you could easily complete this one too... chucks instructions keep you in place and is easy to understand.take this course and get amazed
Excellent instructor and material. Great opportunity to start something in new in terms of learning new skills and polishing very old skills I thought I had lost. It was fun and although challenging at times it was a great experience overall!
Its a great course which focuses on all the data structures. you may find all information regarding methods associated with each data structure, but this course has perfectly covered all the ones that are used on a wide range in the industry.
I just loved this course and platform.Quizzes and programming assignment helped me to learn new things.It is just amazing and i 'll definitely suggest coursera to everyone i know and i'll try to complete as many courses as possible.Thank You.
Thank you Dr. chuck and coursera. This was my second online class  and both class was by Dr. chuck. I really enjoyed thi course and ready to take next class by Dr. chuck. Dr. chuck not only teaches but also introduce student to famous person.
excellent course and professor who explains the basic concepts well. The assignment is great and not hard which just requires using knowledge learned from the video. Strongly recommend for those who have the desire to learn python as a start.
Getting more complicated than the 1st course, but managed it! Just wanna thank DR. chuck, he is truly an extraordinary instructor who knows really well how to teach entertainingly! FYI, the graduation ceremony video really made me laugh hard!
one of the best courses I ever learned,each topic explained very thoroughly . I liked the dictionary section and file section very much. guess tuples are easy, but are underdogs, they can be game changers  in next lessons . Thank you Dr.Chunk
This was fascinating. From aside and first glance it looks very easy. I said what is just stings,tuples,lists. bu when you watch the exlanation and tasks parts you see that what new stuff you have leardned and how deeply tasks urge you to go.
Excellent pace and great course material. I like having both the videos and slides to refer to, as it allows me to continue studying in environments where I can't play a video. The content turned out to be unexpectedly useful in my work, too.
I'm so glad I have been a part of this course, it has been really useful, I've taken course one and two and I know I still have a long way to complete the specialization but I hope I will be able to finish it as it would be really helpful :)
Dr Chuck Severance is THE perfect teacher. This course was a very rewarding and confidence-boosting experience. I'm sure it will go a long way in building my proficiency in Python programming.Thank you Dr Chuck & thank you, UMich & Coursera!
This course greatly helped in understanding basic concepts of Python data structures and at the same time motivated me further for pursuing advanced courses in Python programming. I would like to thank the instructor for this awesome course.
The data structures in python have been explained very well by the instructor. I would recommend this course to anyone who is a beginner in python. This will serve well to solidify basic concepts before moving onto advanced python libraries.
A Wonderful course for learners and enjoyed a lot during this course .It helped me a lot to gain some knowledge on data structures. I thank instructors for guiding me in this course. I am eager to do many more courses in this Specialization
Thanks Prof. Chuck for the great course and material! This course has taught me a lot about Data Structures in Python and it is a great introduction to this topic. It makes sense as a continuation of the first course "Python for Everybody".
really informative and helps you with understanding the basics of python, would defiantly recommend the entire 5 course sequence to anyone looking to get into programming or any field in computer science such as ML which i intend to do next
Excellent course. Takes you through all the basics and gradually builds from there. Prof Charles has done a stellar job with explaining the concepts in a clear and concise manner. Kudos to the team for putting together this fabulous course.
Really, very Good and Challenging Assignments, I impressed as you stoped giving Solutions to Assignments in Videos,and It made me to revise and remember all the previous Topics and made me perfect in all the Concepts learning. Thanks a Lot.
Great course for gaining fundamentals of Python!   Each new skill I learn from this course can be used in my job, as a data analyst, and add some of the underlying skills necessary to pursue data science.  I look forward to the next course!
Excellent for beginners. Many a thanks to Dr Chuck, boy he really  makes it easier to learn. Quiz and Assignment reiterates the slides taking out revision pain. Personally I liked the extra videos and Dr Chuck singing "I got my Mojo.." ya..
Even a person with zero knowledge of programming can learn Python very quickly!! Dr Chuck is just amazing! ;) Completely recommend this course, irrespective of whether you wish to learn Python, with or without prior programming experience!
Once again Dr. Chuck does a great job of introducing data structures. This course really starts to broaden your horizons of what's possible with code and data. His teaching style and materials go a long way to make it easy to learn Python!
This course is clearly more demanding than the first one, but nonetheless, it provided me with good knowledge of lists, dictionaries and tuples and how to implement them. And not to forget: the bonus material is always worth taking a look.
This has been a very helpful and amazing course to learn about common data structures in python. Once again I enjoyed learning with Dr. Chuck in the second course of the specialization and I look forward to completing this specialization.
This was a very useful course in building a solid working knowledge of python when dealing with basic data. Prof Severance has an ideal disposition for teaching, and exibits the expertise you hope for from an online instructor. Real deal.
Awesome Course. This was my first course on Coursera and I loved the journey which I think was possible only due to Prof. Charles Russell Severance. I love the way he teaches and the energy he contains to live the life and learn. Cheers!!
Again, Dr. Chuck(Charles Severance) is a great instructor! I wish all people who wants to learn programming has him as a mentor. Very high quality course with good(means not easy) assigments, fun, great English and certificate at the end.
This course gave me in depth understanding of the concepts in Python Data Structures.The course is designed in a progressive manner and is well-taught by the instructor.I'd great time learning new concepts and adding them to my skill-set.
good programming intro lecture. i've have pretty much industrial knowledge of it, and while taking it as a review course, still find some parts deserves thinking deeper. Also find the relevant author interview section quite interesting :)
Great course for beginners, have a lot of interesting examples. The materials are useful and very easy to understand. Thank you so much for the instruction and wish you great success in helping the world learn how to write in DEAR PYTHON!
Another awesome course with Dr. Chuck! Even if you have no previous programming knowledge, Dr. Chuck leads you gently into it, his explanations are extremely clear and precise, and he's so fun! Looking forward to the next Python course :)
It's a fantastic course with comfortable and manageable content and pace, it goes deeper from the basic skills in Course 1 and helps us to obtain a good foundation before advancing to the next. Highly appreciate and recommend the course.
easy to follow and interesting course. I don't have any prior experience in any programming languages, but I find this course interesting  enough to fall in love with python. Special thanks to Dr. Chuck for his brilliant way of teaching.
The material is presented in a very simplified manner. The assignments support the cause of study material nicely. Dr. Chuck has ensured it that even the slightly complex parts become comfortable for toddlers in the field of programming.
This is my 2nd MOOC course and also 2nd Python course. It was a great course. It explained concepts well and best thing about this course is that it doesn't explain every details and it let you do the hard work and not being spoon-feed.
These online courses are very well designed. I gave u coding long time ago. In this pandemic quarantine, I thought let's give it a shot again. And these courses have got me into coding again. I've lost my apathy thanks to these courses.
This course is a good introduction to Python data structures for beginners, for experienced programmers may require a little patience, but will give you a good overview of how things are handled in Python different for example from Java
It's a wonderful course with appropriate study material . It is a well designed course which could easily be understood with little bit of efforts. Thanks to Dr. Charles for his tremendous teaching he just made the things simple for us.
Really appreciate the courses provided by this professor. Clear explanation and fun videos of his personal experience. I have never seen another professor who can teach these content seriously in such an interesting and attractive way.
Just like the first course this course was pretty interesting and fun to do. I enjoyed the whole process of python coding through and through. Thanks a lot to Professor Charles Severance, Univ. of Michigan and coursera for this course.
Amazing teaching faculty I got it. I am so happy that very easy understand every concept and logic. I am interested to learn more courses from this faculty. Thank you sir making me too good knowledge and understanding on data structure
I highly recommend anyone who has finished Programming for everybody to continue with this course. In the meantime, it will be good to constantly review all the things you learned by reading the textbook, which provide extra exercises.
This course is one of  the best course if you wish to start learning Python in an efficient way. The instructor has explained the concepts very well as well as the approach to writing a piece of code in a structured and logical manner
By the end of the course all the hours of debugging begin to make sense. The course is consistent with the first of the series with regard to structure and support. Very effective in delivering the basics of data structures in python.
Five stars without any doubts. Material is well-explained. Instructor is great. Maybe a little lack is the number of exercises provided in the course, but they can be found somewhere else, on the internet and in some open-source book.
Thank you very much for this course 2, Dr. Chuck. I am learning a lot from your specialization courses. Lists, Dictionary and Tuples are a bit confusing but they are all important but Dr. Chuck always makes all materials fun to learn!
It's a great course. All concepts very simply explained. You sort of need to refer them again because you are learning quite a lot of things and it's a bit difficult to hold everything at once while you're completing your assignments.
Although simple it is a quite an effective course. The platform is reliable, the host is great, the assignment well calibrated and, although they made sound pointless, I quite enjoy the short students around the world videos. Thanks!!
Dr. Charles Severence has taught me the basics of python programming in a very simplified manner and because of his lectures I am able to write my basic programmes with minimal help from internet sources and without making a mistake.
This course is very good for beginners.Also this course is well constructed and descriptive .It covers python concepts in very good manner,And lastly I just want to say thank you to instructor Dr.chuck for being such good instructor.
Participated in this course, I started to understand how to use python to solve some basic problems during daily life. The courses of university of Michigan taught by Dr.Chuck are very helpful for those who want to know about python.
i have some experience with Python but used this course as a refresher. Dr Chuck has an infectious attitude which makes me want to smile whenever I listen to him. i am starting course 3 now and that has some really interesting stuff.
I really became more familiar with the 'flow' of this course in this section.  Thus, I ended up completing more exercises and engaging more with tutors and fellow students.  Great online course, it has really cheered me up this week.
I've completed python-for-everybody course. This course teaches you about data structures in python that are list, dictionaries and tuples. and How to use and manipulate these data structures. Dr. Charles Severance is a good teacher.
Before starting this python courses, I was in no idea how a programming language would be, I just thought its some sort of codes which will be written by great person, and now I am extremely happy to be a person who knows programming
Very much essential for beginners/intermediate. The instructor had taken enough time to make sure the concept of data structures in python is made clear to the learners. I truly appreciate the efforts of the professor. Thanks a ton.
Dr. Charles Severence is an amazing tutor. The way he handles the concepts and structures them to aid the ease of understanding among the course takers while also making sure that the lectures are enjoyable is commendable. 5/5 stars
thanks!You are the best not only online lecturer I ever had but the best lecturer I ever had. speaking from all your heart, giving the best you can. I really appreciate the time you spend making this course available for every body.
Doing this course was a fun experience for me. All these new terms- dictionaries, tuples, etc. were pretty intimidating at first but turned out to be pretty easy. Dr. Chuck's delivery of course material immediately puts one at ease.
For the first time since I started learning Python, I got to use it to do something useful. This course has now opened my eyes to the wider possibilities of things I can do with Python. Many thanks to Dr Chuck and the Coursera team.
Great course that let us know how to implement data structure on file data. Everywhere else they teach the use of lists on some random, less complex data. But here they teach us to use a list, tuples, and dictionary on complex data.
I Think This Course Is All About FIle Structure of Python And How To Handle Files And Operations on File In Python Not About Data Structure So You Should Change The Name Of The Course Or You Should Change The Content Of This Course.
Very-very-very thanks! I'm a philologist, this course is a dream. Now I can make myself a frequency dictionary of the text, 20 years I wanted it. Professor Severance is brilliant. He is able to teach a Python even a bedside table :)
This course won't let you down with exercises that don't apply to what you'd really use in real life. This is clearly the best course on the subject for the beginner programmer. Really. It's seriously the best on the internet today.
DR. Chuck's teaching methodology is extremely engaging and simplistic. The exercises are very well designed. Attempting them not only strengthens our concepts but also boosts confidence in our acquired knowledge. Thankyou Dr. Chuck.
More interesting than the first course. Topics are interesting and help form a foundation for using Python. The exercises were more challenging and interesting to work, causing more thought with how the tasks needed to be completed.
Just like the previous class on these Specialization. The teaching method and the dynamics of the class is very enjoyable. Finally, I am learning Python without the suffering. Excellent course, excellent teacher, excellent material.
Very elaborate explanations in a way you feel you can do it. Dr. Chuck really is a great teacher. Also the clips about the history of computing are very worthwhile and just shows how far we have come and better : how far we can get.
Now I am getting interested in this language. In the previous course, some topics seemed hard that I used to just use without a clear understanding. I think I am overcoming those problems after completing this course. Thanks a lot.
It was a great journey. With this course , data structure seem very interesting and you'll have a great fun solving those assignments. And after the completion of one course , you'll just want to do it further . Loving coursera. :)
I had no previous experience with Python. I have already taken two courses (Python for Everybody and Python Data Structures), and I have found them to be extremely easy for beginners like myself. I strongly recommend these courses.
This course contains very useful information about data structures related to python. That content is brilliantly taught by the instructor. So, I would like to thank him for giving me a quality experience about Python fundamentals.
Brilliant intro to Data structures. The lectures are sufficient to understand the concepts, and the Graded exercise helps put them in practice. I will suggest attempting ALL problems from the textbook chapters as well for practice.
As an old timer I used to struggle dealing with Data Structures in C Programming and this course brought me upto date so effectively and easily. I now understand why  Python is critical in today's world. Thank you very much Charles
brilliant course. The course was so neatly laid out and the assignments and quizzes are deigned to reinforce the concepts learned in the respective chapters. The videos are not too long and you can just finish a course in 1 weekend
Charles is my main man. He does an amazing job of explaining things in such intuitive ways and you gotta love his sense of humor. Plus the course itself is suuuuper informative. They've really found a nice cadence for the material.
All credit goes to the lecturer. It was explained in a very good way. to build the base strong. I started python with strings, but now I feel like taking the basic course also like loops and functions. Thank you very much Dr Chuck.
A beautiful introduction to data structures using python. The explanation is simple and easy to follow. The assignments require the application of the concept learnt and helps understand the application of various data structures.
I really enjoyed learning Python Data Structures. The course design was awesome with assignments. I thank you Charles Russell Severance for giving this wonderful opportunity to learn the Python Data Structures. Thank you coursera.
Great thanks to Professor Severance ! He made this course enlighting and FUN!I had a little difficulty finishing some of the assignments, but fortunately I managed to finish them all, and the feeling of accomplishment is so great!
Clarifies the difference between methods and functions, data structures, variable types. Now reading other resources  on the internet makes even more sense. I feel encouraged to continue studying the rest of the course (and book).
This course provides a gentle dive into the ocean of programming. I had no previous formal exposure to coding, and I love the way Dr.Chuck introduces each concept and drills them into the students in a way that is just so awesome!
The course was simple, fun and fast. The lecturer explained everything in detail. The assignments were extremely practical, and worked examples were provided, so you have an understanding of what you are to do in your assignment.
Wow!... it's a wonderful course. Before attending this course I was not having much knowledge about python and how to use python programming. But now I'm confident enough to to it. Thanks to Dr. Chuck for such a wonderful course.
I really enjoyed the course. This course is organized and explained very well. It is moderately challenging, and I recommend it to get interested in Python. The teacher and the assistant staff are very good. I enjoyed the course.
Python for everyone - on MOOC platform. This is one of best course. I have started from scratch & felt very comfortable to understand the difficult programming in simpler way. Dr. Chuck is knowledgeable & made me stay connected .
This course is the best course I have ever stdied . It makes me intersted in python and coursera .Tanks to doctor chuck, I studied this course in two  days with a lot of fun . This course is so good . Welcome to jion this course!
Great course 👍. I really have respect for instructor specially. He is great at teaching as well as he is good person. I never felt boring throughout the course. This is amazing course by God sake. I recommend everyone to do it.
Fantastic course with very immersive lectures from Dr. Chuck. Also many opportunities to apply your knowledge with the external grading tool. Very fun and challenging to see how far you can get without checking your notes. 10/10
This an excellent course to start the python journey. Python Data structures are explained in a way too easy and interactive manner. The assignments will surely increase your thinking ability and the hunger to learn more & more.
This is an excellent course for anybody who wants to learn python and doesn't have a computer science background! If you do have previous experience (outside of the first iteration of this course) the pacing might be a bit slow.
though its the first time I've studied data structure I won't get stuck anywhere explaining of concepts is very awesome its easy to understand really it was a nice experience i have got and lots of knowledge through this course.
I really like how Dr. Charles Severance teaches and explains. I am not a programmer, nor planning to be one, I just want to understand how programming works so I need simple and logical concepts. He makes everything seem doable.
High Five for such a stupendous and flawless teaching effort. Dr. Chuck you are my real life celebrity. Please do visit India and conduct an office hour, I am sure you will have more fans like me here, more than anywhere may be.
Great course. Very clear presentations as well as examples on the differences and different purposes of the major python data structure types. Assignments are just at the right level of difficulty and explanations are available.
Really it is the first time in my life that I have loved so much that Iam studing. A big part of the credit goes to our teacher Charles Severance. He is just great. Thank you soo much coursera for providing us with this course.
Python data structures is very important, it stores and access data i.e, in the form List,tuples,sets,dict.etc.So it is very important to go through the course thoroughly and gain knowledge to build your skills in programmimg..
Very approachable, great method to make concepts understandable with a litttle effort. Highly recommend it. I have tried a couple of other MOOCS on Python and this one by Doc Severance from the U of Michigan is the best by far.
I truly enjoyed this course. There have been multiple books on python, courses on python, even some on coursera, but none went beyond the basics. This was exactly what I was looking for to get to the next level. Thanks, Sridhar
I learnt a lot from this course. now i am able to understand what is list,what is dictionary and what is tuple.in this course i learnt about data structures. THANKS A LOT COURSERA AND MY INSTRUCTOR Dr. CHARLES SEVERANCE.......
Course is really simplified and keeps you interested through out. The additional assignments ensure that you have grasped properly what you have learnt and helps in testing yourself. A must do if you want a firm base in Python
It was so good experience of learning in Coursera platform and Dr.charles severance teached in a simple way .He conveyed in a good manner and he makes python very easy to me.Thank you sir and Coursera for this wonderful course
This was a good introduction to computer programming and Python, taught in an engaging way. I also liked the suggestions for how to improve your chances in landing computer science and related jobs (offered in the final unit).
It was amazing learning from Dr. Chuck. He explained each and everything in detail and tried his best to deliver what he knows. The best part is the bonus video in each lesson which gives goosebumps. Overall, great experience.
Doing this course I have learnt a lot of new things in python . This course in total was awesome and I really loved it .  I would recommend all of you who want to learn and understand python at the same time to do this course.
i found it more challenging than the first course, much more information and it because a bit more difficult for me to retain all the information. However, I find Python interest although it can be frustrating increasingly so.
Great course to learn various data structures. I really enjoyed the course. I liked most the graduation section. Wow! gives the feeling you have really graduated. There was also a lot of motivation in session the 4Ps! and 4Cs!
I really love this specialization, the way dr. Charles explains and teaches it's so funny and comprehensible, I also like a lot the bonus videos at the end of each week. One of the best courses I taked (if isn't the best) ❤😎
I loved this course. The professor teaches really well, in a very interesting way. I wish he could teach me all my classes. If you like programming, it's very likely this set of courses will make you fall in love with python.
I LIKED THE COURSE VERY MUCH. I GOT SO MUCH INTEREST ON PYTHON AND CONFIDENCE ON ME THAT I CAN CODE IN PYTHON AFTER TAKING THIS COURSE. LECTURES WERE VERY INTERACTIVE AND TEACHING IS TOO GOOD. I LOVED THE WAY PROFESSOR TAUGHT
I didnt even know how to code the program and was afraid of doing it thinking that it was too hard for me to learn .But Dr.Chucks exlaination was mindblowing he is one of the worlds grt teacher..thankyou very much sirrr...!!!
I loved the way in which the professor has taught python data structures. Though I find tuples some off-grid. In the end, I found it was a great experience.  Now, I am looking forward to this specialization. Thanks, Dr Chuck.
Great course and i can learn at my own pace, excellent course for any beginner.Even without zero programming language, you can start this learning course. You will definitely pick this up. Best Online course till date for me.
Excellent Course in continuation of the first six chapters of course one, this course completes the tools needed for programming, the whole specialization provides everything I can ask from a monogramming course for beginners
I really learned much from this course and was also able to beat my fears of programming. Now I can't wait  to further my study. The fact that there's a small graduation ceremony at the end just made me feel that much better.
Great course. A Little bit more complicated that the firts one but quite easy anyway for people who wants to learn some programming for first time or if you have to improve your programming skills with a new program language.
Great course. Everything turned out very cool. The course is suitable for beginners, if you know little about programming, then this is the perfect course for you. All theoretical and practical points are explained in detail
it's a wonderful course , helped  me a lot in learning more about python and proper use of it from basic usage to wherever possible to enhance my coding skills ,  found it easy ,  understandable and good course to complete .
THANKS ALOT FOR THIS AMAZING COURSE...!  I'm not able to express my gratitude towards Professor Chuck. It's definitely the best  Python beginners course and in the end, the Graduation Ceremony feels so so real....THANKS ALOT
Totally loved it!. Dr.chuck is the best teacher I have ever came under and the way he explains the concept made it more easy for me to understand. And thank you Dr.chuck for the advices and future related talks and learning.
It's really one of the best programming course I've taking through different learning platform including MOOCs. 
I just want to say, if you are new in python and want to learn this, take a look at this course from Dr. Chuck!
Dr Severance has a way with teaching. It's evident. Talking to an inanimate camera and sounding as if he is really seeing and talking to you makes it look really interactive. Hope to have many more lessons from Dr Severance.
A well Elaborated and Practical apporach by Professor. I am well aware of the different and efficient Data Structures used in python. Thanks to the Professor and Coursera for helping me getting the good grasp of the language
This is a tres nice course. I have tried many and they all were terrible but this one I understand, I like the teacher, and the videos are clear. I feel like I have learned a lot. Thank you so much!!!! :)mbox-short.txt  FTW!
This course is too good. The instructor, Dr. Charles is very helpful person. He covered all the data structures of python like strings, lists and tuples in the best way possible. This course is the best way to learn Python.
The courses of Dr. Chuck are really passionate because he can simplify and expose topics with high complexity.You will learn very useful functions like open text files and search key words/charactes into the files and more.
The course is really very very good...I am just loving this...the entire course and the teacher is really really awesome....It is really easy to understand and the way it is explained one will fall for python...seriously...
Thanks greatly for Dr. Churk's nice instructing, this is my 2nd complated Coursera course, and it's nice experience for learning here!I will continue for my learning journey, and wish to have more courses learning from you!
Thank you, Dr. Chuck! Thank you, COURSERA! Thanks for the financial aid program that allows us to learn for free and confirm the skills aquired from these courses by getting a confirmed sertificate! Thanks and best regards!
I won't say it was a comprehensive lesson on data structures but more than enough to get you started. Really enjoyed the lectures and Prof. Chuck's enthusiasm. I believe the exercises could have been a bit more challenging.
Excellent work! Iadvise anyone take this course! I wish in the near future, Coursera and more specifically, Michigan University to offer Mathematics with python, i.e. numpy, pandas etc and doing data analysis with python!!!
FILE HANDLING, LIST, DICT, TUPLE WITH SORTING FEATURE ADDED IN LOOPIE ENVIRONMENT.WOW.HATS OFF TO U SIR CHARLES FOR UR EFFORT....I WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOU...I AM REALLY HAPPY TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THIS COURSE
It was a joyful learning. Every concept of respective topics are explained in very cool and funway by Charles Sir. And the best part that I like was its assignments... just like we are giving a power booster to our mind...
Loved this specialisation!The last assignment was absolutely challenging and while I struggled with it for quite some time, it felt great to complete it!Goes to show that there is real high quality content in this program!
Easy way to learn the concepts. Install python locally as it helps to have a concrete understanding when you start typing code in the chevron prompt. Course is charted out well as you don't feel any difficulty in learning.
Very instructive while being kind of a challenge, despite my previous education as an engineer and previous knowledge in C, Pascal, ADA . I love the style Dr. Chuck gives his lessons and will strive to meet him personally.
You're the best Dr. Chuck! I love the way you teach and keep the classes fun. Even though I know a bit of Python, there are so many exciting topics that you've covered in this course which I had no idea about them before.
A must have courses for those who need to boost their programming skills and have excited time with scheduled quiz and assignments. Dr.Chuck is amazing instructor who teaches amazing Python stuff with much needed patience
Great course! This second part of the beginners course is important alongside your basic fundaments learned on the first part. Chuck knows how to get you learning constantly with each lesson. I really recommend this MOOC.
Great course but the assignments are too easy it should be a little bit tough and also quiz should include code questions, not MCQs so that students can learn coding in a better way it will help him thinking and practice.
The course is simply awesome. It creates your interest in programming, it teaches you from the basics of the coding. The way of teaching is awesome, helped to learn in a fun way The Bonus sessions are quite great as well.
It's a useful course. The lectures are all easy to understand. The exercises are difficult enough for me to check whether I understand the lectures clearly or not. Finally, thank you Dr.Chuck for his interesting lectures.
Well designed class, it's clear and instructive. I really feel like I have learnt new skills. I would recommend it especially if you already have taken the first introductory class and wish to continue discovering Python.
Extremely useful specially for non-programmers like me to understand the depth of this language. I feel more confident to undertake more advance courses based on Python. I would definitely recommend this course to others.
this course is actually very nice and easy to get with, if you a new learner just don't worry, it won't take you  a lot of time, and you will really get familiar with Python and how everything will work after learning it.
As I feel basic courses should be open and free. (Whereas advance courses can be chargeable.) It is not worth the money to pay for basic course. It should at-least be open in Audit mode if it can't be made completely free
The instructor is very positive and he encourages the students to think and solve the problem.I have taken my courses taught by doctor Charles and I can say that he is amazing professor .I wish he taught at my university.
This course was challenging for me as a beginning programmer but it was taught very well. The professor and the book are awesome. If you have a question there is always a Mentor with coding experience around who can help.
Professor Chuck is stellar. He is knowledgable and very likable. I appreciate that the videos aren't scripted and polished. The lectures feel like I'm having a conversation with him. He also makes me laugh in every video.
This course has helped me in advancing my journey in Python to a level where I can now understand all the basic data structures and various methods associated with them. We can use these methods for various common tasks.
Did this to review some basic Python, and it did just the trick. Got some good practice in and learned a few tips and tricks I missed when I first learned the language. Great intro to basic data structures in CS as well.
Very easy and useful to get data structures in Python. Highly recommend for those who have no prior Python experience or to those who want to move to Python from other languages but has no clue where to start. Good luck!
I love this course, so clear also supported with great assignments where you can train your coding skills immediately. I am planning to take more class with Mr Chuck, I like his way of teaching. Highly recommended class.
Loved the new information learned from this course. I have completed other python courses before but I guess all courses aren't created equally. I just wish the videos were shorter. :) Can't wait to take the next course.
This course is awesome!! I was always an amateur programmer with php and html and thanks to Dr. Severance, I am actually being able to discuss with IT professionals toe to toe!Thank you very much for such awesome course!
I love the teaching style, and he's really great at breaking things down simply and with enough repetition to give you a clear understanding on any remaining unfamiliar topics.  Looking forward to the rest of the course!
The pace of the course is slow if you are already a programmer and are familiar with the basics of Python. However, the course is well-organized and well-delivered. Dr. Severance is funny and makes learning Python a joy.
I continued this course after 'Programming for everybody' one of the five of the bunch 'Python for everybody'. And I feeling confident about programming skills I've learnt.I am looking forward pursue the next courses...
again done another course by Dr. Chuck. He is a wonderful teacher for the beginner. Makes Everything really easy to understand. This code is amazing for the beginners as it starts from scratch after the Beginner course.
This is the most fun teacher I've seen on Coursera. He made this course so much easy and interesting. I don't like programming that much because I rarely understand it. But now I can't wait to advance to the next level.
I feel incredible that I knew almost nothing about programming just a month ago. Now I have done two of the courses of the specialization and I can actually understand other basic codes. Great course! Thank you coursera
Such an amazing and educational course! Being a 9th grader in school, this was a flexible course and it was also very detailed and simple to understand. I also loved how helpful and efficient the discussion forums were!
It's the second course of the Python specialization course. Dr. Chuck just made programming so funny and consice. Very good for beginners even if you don't have any background. I love this course. Thank you Dr. Chuck :)
I love Dr Chucks way of teaching and making you see how fun programming can be! This is one of the main reasons that keeps me here, even though I'm a junior Engineering student + part time jobat a lab. Totally worth it!
It was great to see Dr. Charles to teach the Data structure of Python. With this I would say I can now do and understand codes much more better than before. I thank Dr. Charles once again for this wonderful experience.
probably the best instructor one can get in an online course. the content of the course was really interesting and the exercises were adequate and most importantly obliges to go through a certain kind of brainstorming.
I have totally learned the data structures in Python from Prof.Dr Chuckand I thank him very much for the excellent structure of this course, the cordial language and the complete mastery of the content of the training.
I'm getting better and better at my first programming language, Python! Looking forward to realizing my potential when I complete this specialization and move on to the next thing on my journey. This course is awesome.
The course slowly and steadily helps in building the basic concepts for Data Structures in Python.A must for all, with no prior knowledge of python Data Structures, who are planning to dive deep in Computing in future.
An excellent follow-up to Getting Started with Python. Dr. Chuck does an amazing job explaining and laying the groundwork for working with data structures in Python. I can't wait to start the next course in the series.
This course is amazing . It's getting more and more complex and the assignments are getting harder,too. But I'd like to say it's so much fun to learn Python here. And I want to say thanks to all the professors and TAs.
This is the second course in this specialization. But definitely one the best and most important in fact. Professor Charles is a great lecture. Exercises and Assignments will definitely make a student think. Thank you.
Very applicable to real world development, but well thought out and executed for all levels to learn.    Being a Data Engineer, I had a difference of opinion on one of the SQL questions exams, but all in all great job!
Amazing experience with Dr. Chuck indeed an awesome instructor and a great personality.I recommend this course as this gives you insight of what's going on and instructor did a great job in clearing all those concepts
The course really helped me change my perspective towards coding. Earlier, I used to think that coding was very tough. But now, with the Help of Dr.Chuck's lectures, I developed a very positive feeling towards coding.
Excellent explanation of all the data structures! really enjoyed the way the lectures supplement what is written in the textbook. Dr Chuck is amazing at making it simple enough to understand and remember the material.
Highly recommended! I really enjoyed Dr. Chuck's course! He explains concepts super clearly, and give excellent examples to help reinforce the understanding. Much better than the few python courses I took on Datacamp.
Highly recommended.  Each class builds on previous concepts.  Assignments are completely relevant.  The instructor not only masters his subject matter but is making a great effort in improving the learning experience.
A very good beginning for someone wanting to understand basics of python data structures. One of the most energetic and spontaneous instructors- professor Charles, I wonder what's in the cup he keeps sipping from? :-)
The class was great!  The professor is excellent.  He does a great job of explaining the material, and he's fun to listen to.  He also sprinkles the course with interesting related content.  It was a great experience.
Dr. Chuck is a wonderful teacher! He makes programming seem so accessible. Looking forward to the day that I finish the five courses in this specialization. Hopefully I will be able to program for my future research.
The course is incredible. I had tried to learn python time ago and it had been impossible because many reasons, this course is easy to learn and very didactic. Many Thanks to the instructor, regards from mexico city.
This is one of the best courses on Python programming.The course was well structured and very well presented by Dr.Chuck. The course is fun filled and I really fell in love with python and Dr.Chuck's way of teaching.
This course is very interesting!! Anyone with no knowledge in programming can write programs in python by taking this course. Charles Severance Sir's approach in teaching the concept is so different and interesting!!
Second course with Dr Chuck - it keeps getting better and better.This course has its challenges, and it was really, really rewarding to be able to learn, juggle through the obstacles, and to be able to overcome them.
Great course to play with files , to understand the Data structure of python , and it starts from zero after completing the course you will be able to do a lot with text files , and instructor is really super cool :)
Great course.  This is the only practical course on Python that I have ever seen.  I began using my new skills right away.  This course was very useful in giving me relevant skills that could be put to immediate use.
Dr. Charles is such a tremendous educator, communicator and enthusiastic person. Every minute spend in front of the screen listening and watching him guide you into Python will be an absolute delight. Thanks Charles!
A simple and very productive way to learn Python. It wouldn't be as easy as it was if it wasn't for Dr. Chuck's great sense of humor and tremendous effort to keep us motivated. Thank you to Dr. Chuck and the mentors!
It was very interesting. The lecturer is aslo very interesting. I recommend this course.Thanks you for your free ibook "python for informatic" .No doubt I will use python in my job (scientific research). Many thanks.
Very nice second part of introduction to python with great instructor, practical assignments and free ebook provided. I recommend this course to beginners with no prior or small amount of experience with programming.
very interesting course and straightforward. the lecturer is really really good in explaining in an easy to follow way and his examples and exercises were using exactly the knowledge you have to gain from this course
This course ('Python Data Structures') really helped me in building up my programming skills.Very well taught with tricky assignments and in a well organised mannerMr.Chuck is one of the best instructor one can get.
This course is the best way to learn the Python Data Structures and i really loved the way it was taught by Dr. Chuck with as many examples and explanations. Its well curated for the beginners and for intermediates.
Had a general knowledge of programming, but this course has helped me to learn the basics of Python and how to manipulate data into structures that can be analyzed.  Can't wait to continue on with the certification.
Excellent foundation course for Python. It gave a better understanding of easiness of Python and data handling. Professor Charles Severance has excellent handle on the subject and explains well. Thank you very much.
It is a very good course, even for non-programmers. Charles Severance makes a difference in this course. He explains the way that you can understand, it is very helpful. So that, I am still learning Python language.
An excellent course overall.  Dr. Chuck is great - very interesting to following during the video lectures.  The quizzes and exercises are all challenging but not to the point where you cannot figure out what to do.
Really an amazing course it was! Now I am able to link the different concepts of Python. I am grateful to the instructor for making this beautiful course. This course has  made me more eager about the next courses.
I have taken the previous course with Dr chuck, that was awesome, I enjoyed these courses from Dr chuck and I really appreciate this effort to make us learn in a perfect way .. thanks from the bottom of my heart :)
It is amazing to get to know the data structures in python and how to use them. The exercises are appropriate to both teach and challenge you through the course. Very happy with the experience, thank you very much.
Really enjoyed this class. Charles still managed to make it so much enjoyable just as the previous intro to programming course. Looking forward to completing this specialisation with his content - much recommended!
There is everything we should know at basic level. Professor tries to teach basic concept easily. I could understand Data structure and its using. And also the textbook can make up for the weak part of the lecture.
I thought this course was great while I was doing it... but now that I've gone on to other courses / resources and have seen how much I've developed as a coder as a result, I'm even more impressed! Chuck is a hero!
I loved this course, the teacher has a unique and friendly tone and does a great job of explaining all the concepts, making everything easy to follow. I greatly appreciate all who contributed to making this course.
This is a very well-formatted summary on the basic data structures in Python. It is very informative and I recommend it to anyone who knows a bit of Python but is still not fluent in using the different structures.
it's pretty nice and the University of Michigan made it way too simple to understand this language. More likely to appreciate the professor (Charles Russell Severance ) who delt and taught us python .thank you sir
This was a great course. The instructor was very clear and explained each and everything very nicely. After completing the course many of my doubts in python data structures are cleared. Greatly loved this course.
The course is great with slides provided. However, if students who post their questions in forum could be answered with detailed explanations instead of other questions, it would help them in a more effective way.
Dr Charles Russell Severance is the best teacher I have ever met in 16 Years of my educational life. It was a great privilege that I took this course. It surely benefitted me as I utilized my free Quarantine time.
Well, this is quite a good startup towards building a base for understanding fundamentals of python data structures in a simple, understandable and cool way just like our teaching instructor Sir Charles Severence.
Great Course to have specialization in Python Programming...Learning a lot from these courses and many more to complete and way to go....Recommended to everyone who want to learn python in easiest possible way....
Everything is so clear with the video explanations! The pdf (book) is also very usefull. I am a complete beginner in Python or programming, but I enjoy this course very much! Thanks a lot Charles S. and your team!
Dr Charles Severance is so adorable and I do enjoy his class. Initially I thought python must be not easy to learn, but I gradually absorbed the knowledge and built a solid foundation for more complex programming.
This course is awesome! No matter how hard it was, Dr. Chuck is all explained in a simple way that everyone can understand. I recommend this course as mandatory reading for the data structure in Python !!! Tom  :)
Very good teaching, for beginners "Python Data Structures" course is very helpfull we get a more idea about store and retrive data from files,working with list,dictionary,tuplesit is very good work sir, Thank you
I love the style and humor of professor Severance during his lectures. And the exercise after each chapter is helpful in building up python skills. Hope there would be some advanced exercise posted for us to try.
As per the first module I found this very engaging and clear. I feel a bit overwhelmed now and feel like I need more practice, but it's all crystal clear so far! I'm looking forward to beginning the next course!
it's huge help to learn about Python Data structures,everything in this course is knowledgeable,i get to know about lots of thing about how data is used in python, and it help to increase my knowledge .Thank you
I started to learn this course because of my curiosity about programming world. And I love this class so much, for Pro. Chuck is such a great teacher who could easily made the learning interesting. Thanks again!
Somewhat challenging towards the end, but also very interesting.  I appreciate the small scale on which one operates in this course, but it is easy to see how one could scale Python to perform much larger tasks.
Very Good. This is my one of the best MOOC I enjoyed. The exercises were indulging and encouraging. Wish Dr Chuck our best for future such easy to understand session and enlighten many more like me. Thanks much.
This course helped me learn most of the python commands I need to solve the problem. I read the book first and worked on all the problems before taking this course and it helped greatly to hone my coding skills.
That was an amazing course with an amazing Dr. Chuck teaching! The material is truly foundational and Dr.Chuck's manner of teaching really help to learn it well. He perfectly combines knowledge and fun! 5 stars!
I have enjoyed the course ,learned python skills, moreover this course  assignments make me to develop my problem solving ability. A suggestion from me that course materials need to be more dig into the topics.
Great instructor .. I hesitated to start with Python or any programming language...But with Dr.Charles, I start both Python and SQL.I highly recommend every single course that is taught by Dr.Charles.Thank you.
Dr. chuck is an awesome instructor. this course is best suited for people who get bored very easily. Dr. chuck and the assignments will keep you engaged all the time. and in no time you'll start to love PYTHON.
Learned so much, and I have a much better understanding of programming and how the Engineers I work with design our code base. I now feel comfortable enough navigating our code base and look for potential bugs.
Well. I had none of experience about data structure and just attended first course of python but I didnt feel any frustrated during the course. I felt learning and motivated. Great course for starter in Python!
I love the way Dr. Chuck explaining different data structures in Python. It's so clear! and also I love those design of quiz, they made me more familiar with the contents.thanks you for such a wonderful course!
I have been writing software for going on 40 years, but had never taken the time to learn Python. Dr. Chuck has made it easy to learn the basics and to build a few simple programs that reinforce the principles.
I ran into some big walls while doing the assignments in this course. However, thanks to the Dr. Chuck's lectures and, the support of the staff, helped me get through with a solid understanding of the concepts.
Excellent course! Graduation ceremony is so moving. I will always keep these 8 words in mind: Passion, Purpose, Persistence, Playfulness, Choice, Commitment, Connections, Completion. Thank you again, DR. Chuck.
Great introduction to Python - have been using python a little while and helped me understand a few points about dicts and tuples that I didn't quite have a grasp on. Could use with moving to Python 3 though...
Prf. Chuck is an excellent teacher, I feel excited every time I complete a program with the indicated specifications. I hope to continue on this path, learning and improving with the python course for everyone
Really good for learning the basics of Python data structures. Relates well to the knowledge of other languages and the teacher is great at explaining things. Exercises are easy enough to progress comfortably.
The course is well structured and the instructor is amazing.He clarifies Python data structure briefly and builds up the concept in an organized way.I am looking forward to learning more about python from him.
dr. chuck is amazing his style is interactive. I like his teaching. the only problem I face during the course is i could under the slides code perfectly but felt little hesitant while attempting the exercises.
This is a very good course for beginners and the way sir teaches is really amazing. He ensures that you won't get bored during the lectures and provides the information, with examples which are then explained.
The course is Structured well for those who are relatively new to programming. The course is well thought out as the chapters are sequential and the home works build up on the previous piece of code you wrote.
Dr. Chuck, thank you for another excellent course. Your charm, sense of humor, and carefully crafted lessons are a joy to follow and complete. I look forward to the next courses in the specialization with you!
Thank you all for this great course. I've learned a lot of things with Python and with Dr. Chuck. Thanks for the great jobs and all open course material and all things to promote education. Thanks from Brazil.
I really had some knowledge with this course because of my course instructor of this course, who made this course easy to understand and also made it easy, I wish I could take more courses offered by coursera
The content is great, lecturer is great and overall one of the best online courses I've done. Finished in 3 days. Thanks a lot Chuck! Can't wait to do the next course and many more of your courses. Peace! Em.
It's really cool way of deciphering the data structure using python, Dr Chuck as always is the best in keeping interesting exercises which really tests the skills learned in the course. Thanks a lot Dr. Chuck
The lectures are excellent and the pace of the course is just to right absorb the information and complete the assignments with enough challenge to get you thinking but no so much you feel it's too difficult.
Great for someone new to the language. The structure and layout of the course is perfect, Dr Chuck makes the learning enjoyable and the graded online assignments are good to ensure you understand the concept.
Course is awesome but the only issue i faced during the course-time is that in one question in quiz of strings chapter it was incomplete and i've to guess the answer which i manged to get it on my third try.
It is interesting to learn python 3 in this class, from which I really learned something about Python Data Structures. The assignment is adaptable for me, which helped me review the knowledge in the courses.
Thank you so much Dr. Chucks sir. This course details are really helpful for a beginner.I'm learning techniques of coding and implementing codes by my own. There was a time when I was not liking to do codes.
Amazing, before this course "Python for everybody". I was a noob to python programming language but now after taking 2 courses in this specialization I am able to write small programs, Thank you Sir CHARLES.
Material was good and the instructor explained the material well, using good examples and spoke clearly such that one could understand easily. Good course, recommended for everyone who wants to learn Python.
It was really fun and informative. Assignment problems are really good. And Mr. Chuck you are such a nice person, I wish we could meet sometime. I am from Delhi, India in case you are booking flight tickets.
A great course, helped me a lot to get strong  at data structures fundamentals , and also the assignments were helpful they're more realistic , I found them unique and simple. it was a wonderful expierience.
It is very informative course that enhances my python skills. The content of the course and building of assignments are very efficient. The explanation of course by Dr.Charles Russell Severance is also best.
Great course to start learning programming. All the concepts are well explained with a good pace for everybody. I would recommend this course anyone new to programming or even to brush up their knowledge....
This course is the most useful python lecture I've seen! I learned basic python knowledge in a short period of time. also, It's not just a boring programmer language lecture. I have so much fun during study.
Very worthwhile. I tried several times getting through Python on my own, but I kept running into weird issues and this time I was able to get through some of the bumps. Sometimes a little hand holding helps.
It didn't take terribly long for me to complete this course, and I learned a lot! Professor Severance is a wonderful instructor and I look forward to continuing this Python specialization under his guidance.
I really liked the course, the professor simplified the subject even someone with no computer science background should be able to grasp the concept. It was something to do and learn and I really enjoyed it.
Excellent course and excellent teacher.The course is well organized that though it's a bit rough at the beginning , once you get into the mindset the video lectures and assignments come together very easily.
Charles Severance is an awesome teacher.His way of explaining concepts really makes me get more interested in python and overall programming.I would recommend this course to anyone interested in programming.
I am very happy that i have completed this course,i highly appreciate the efforts took by the professor,i am highly impressed by his teaching ways...i recommend this course to my fellow learners.Thanks sir.
Charles is such a patient instructor and who has complete understanding of how a newbie to Python need to understand complex stuff. Appreciate the effort put in preparing the examples, course structure etc.
Very well explained by Dr. Chuck . Enjoyed learning from you sir. It was not at all boring as the other stuff I have gone through for learning the programming languages. It was fun learning Python from you.
I am a new student of this course.This course is very helpful for learning python data structures.The instructor is so co-operative that I can complete this work very efficiently.So thanks to the instructor
The lecturer was clear and understandable. But can you also provide more practice on auto-grader? they don't necessarily be assignments, but at least we can get some correction or hint from the auto-grader.
This course will help you understand how to easy program with python. It has helped me a lot to understand how "thinks" python and how to solve problems of big text files and e-mails.I totally recommend it.
I started programming with python with no experience with python. I have completed two of the courses of python and it is getting interesting more and more! thank you dr.chuck , you can teach well though :P
In Java learning, I just cannot understand things about files or other higher structures. But by studying after this course, it's just easy when it comes to Python. Thank you to Pro. Severance and Coursera.
This course is a good continuation of the previous course. Prof. Chuck explains everything in a simple yet intuitive manner. The course is enjoyable and the bonus videos at the end are an amazing addition,
One of the best courses on Python with easy to perform coding exercises and quizzes. The course is very well designed accustomed to the beginner's needs. Moreover, the instructor has done a tremendous job.
Absolutely amazing course. The professor is simply awesome in how he is teaching and explaining and the book is also extremely helpful with the exercises. Thank you very much for offering this possibility!
As always, I love the way Dr Chuck teaches the course.  He makes very enjoyable.  The lectures and assignments are easy to understand.  I am looking forward to taking the third class.  Thanks you Dr Chuck!
I like verything about the course: instructor's explanation, structure of the course, tasks. I will definitely recommend it to those who want to start learning programming at least to expand their outlook.
Dr Chuck is a wonderful, wonderful teacher. Thanks to him, every time I am more motivated and cannot wait to start another lesson. Very good basics, lots of examples and assignments performed step by step.
Enjoyed the way he broke everything down. If I were to make one critique, I'd like a section that had additional (optional) exercises to get extra practice to make sure the lessons are committed to memory.
Great course!A must for everyone interested in building software solutions using the python language. Dr. Chucks makes the course fun and interesting. I could not stop watching the video.Thanks Dr. Chucks!
A comprehensive, well-structured and very well taught course. Its really very helpful for beginners.One of the best part of the course is the debugging part because thats where most of us commit mistakes.
While the topics in this course were more challenging and required more effort, through lectures and readings, the instructor helped me understand the beginnings of data structures and their capabilities.
It was one of the best courses I had online. I learned many things including strings, tuples, dictionaries, etc I python. I really enjoyed the course. Now, looking forward to the next course in the queue.
I would say this is the best course of my life. Got a better understanding of Python's Data Structures and hoping to complete all the modules in this specialization.  Thank you very much, Professor Chuck.
The instructor and the material made learning Python Data Structures fun and exciting.  I learned that I have to stop overthinking the solutions since simplicity was always the path to the correct script.
Thanks Charles Severance, Training objectives were clearly explained and achieved,There are too many good points to list! The course was very relevant to my job and will help me in most aspects of my work
This course is a great material to understand data structures in python. I am really advice everyone who wants to learn python to start this course right now, it is a very useful and simple to understand.
I just loved this course. The way of teaching and explaining the things is very nice and descriptive. Dr.Chuck is a great teacher. I am very excited for the coming next two courses in this specialization.
I learned all the fundamental tools of Python language that i could use in my future programming. I'm really looking forward to the next classes that would take me deeper and deeper into the Python world!
Quick and easy introduction to useful Python data extraction tools. A great resource! I especially like that I can move through it at my own pace and move on to more interesting (to me) exercises. Thanks!
Dr Chuck's delivery is excellent. I completed this course quite quickly, I had programming experience but no Python experience, but still felt the videos were well paced and presented the topics clearly.
Thorough explanation of all concepts, brilliant illustrative speech, and an overall excellent course. The proof of concept for each chapter through a given assignment really makes the lessons worthwhile.
If you want to start with data structure in Python , then  it will be great choice. The course content is quite well organized. The quizes and assignments are quite helpful to improve programming skills.
This is a great curse for people with no background in programing or computer science knowledge. The pace, content and method are all perfect. One can easily manage it along with job or formal education.
really really wonderful!!! love this course so much and love the professor so much!!! the professor is so cute that he really tries to give you the certificate and shake you hand behind the screen!!! hhh
Excellent way to learn the fundamentals of Python in a short period of time.  This is the second class; be sure to take "Programming for Everyone (Python)" first.  Well worth the time, money, and effort.
This module was a very good introduction for me to learn the basic tools of Python and its unseen behind process. For the ones who can write algorithms in other languages, this is a perfect introduction.
The course is really good for the beginners......Especially if one refers the recommended book "Python for Everybody" along with the lectures then learning experience becomes pretty enjoyable...........
Alhamdulillah. the course was very useful in understanding how python handles with data. The course is self paced and helps you understand the python data handling in very easy steps.Thanks to Dr. Chuck
Fantastic course! Even after 5 years of Python it is always good to get back to the basics with one of the most fun, clear, concise instructors of Coursera! Thoroughly enjoyed during the lock-down time!
I am in love with coursera, they are awesome and I wish them all the best! They have definitely been a great help so far. This course was great, a well structured second step towards the specialization.
Learned so much more about programming in general and the concepts of extracting data than I thought. If makes it even easier using other languages like C# or Scripting languages like Batch, PowerShell.
Awesome data structure course! Covered everything important I want to know about list, dict, tuples, etc. It is very clear, interesting, and engaging. Can't wait to start the next course from Dr. Chuck!
For first time programmers this seems to be perfect. Coming from multiple other languages it would be nice to be able to (temporarly) hide the detailed hints to the steps in the programming assignments.
This course on Python Data Structure was super-Awesome.It really made me to get interested in Data Structures which I was not able to understand clearlyDr Chuck is just awesome.Looking forward for more
Course moves at a good pace. The instructor seems genuinely passionate about the subject and presents worked solutions 'warts and all' which is a great opportunity to see how to think out the problems.
An excellent course, highly recommend it.  They have mildly gamified the course.  I felt so rewarded after finishing an assignment.  The lecture materials and all course materials were easily obtained.
Dr Chuck is one of the best teachers I have ever met.  His way of teaching complex subjects so simply is a real art.  Thank you Dr Chuck - you have really helped me find a passion in computer science.
I recommend this course to those who want to learn python without any programming experience before. The professor is really nice and make every concept and function very easy and clear to understand.
Clear and concise course about Python basic Data Structures (dictionary, list, tuples). Computer Talks and interviews with relevant Technology leaders. Videos with students and meetings (Office Hours)
This course provides a crystal-clear coverage on Python data structures.  If you need to spin up quickly on Python data structures (file, list, dict, tuple), this will get you there with ease.  Enjoy!
Careful and deliberate coverage of Python's data structures.  Use of the accompanying book provides additional detail beyond the lectures as well as further practice in the use of the data structures.
I really like this courses from Dr. Chuck. Just like previous course, this one has also been entertaining and interesting. I'm looking forward to the rest of courses in this specialization for Python.
very interesting way likeable teaching. I wish if there were more professors using similar teaching approach.This is my 9 th course on coursera and only 2nd i completed -- cause i could get it !Thanks
I'm so happy to take the Python Data Structures course from Dr. Chuck and learning a new programming language becomes a passion for loving what you do. Thank you for sharing your experiences with us.
It
is a very good course with assignment videos, Teaching materials, and Hands-on
activity. In the other course, you can't get such type of facilities. In my
opinion, it is worth your time and money.
I love the way this class i taught. I have been able to understand the logic and flow of programming more than I ever have, even after taking 3 other programming classes in college before!!Thank you!
I feel incredible that I knew almost nothing about programming just a month ago. Now I have done two of the courses of the specialization and I can actually understand other basic codes. Great course
I love the way Dr. Chuck interacts with the students even though its an online class. Nor do I know him personally neither does he know me. But he makes this class interesting. Hats off to Dr. Chuck!
it was amazing course and i'm really exited to go for more courses for python data science and web development with the instructions of Dr.chuck ... thanks for this course and it was very learnable..
I relay enjoyed this course with Dr. Chuck, i found it quite enjoyable and not to hard to get through considering i am not from an coding or i.t. background. looking forward to starting the next one.
It is an excellent and very professional course for anyone who wants to learn Python. It is very well explained and with methods that are not seen in any video on youtube. I recommend it to everyone!
First time tackling this subject and made it through, not taken for granted.Just one thing, if the tutors can be more helpful and review the code with one line of comment it will be much appreciated.
Challenging for someone with zero experience with coding. Took a fairly long time to grind through the first two courses in the specialisation, but the lectures and course material were very helpful.
The course is great but my former experience in programming (C, C++ and PHP) helped me a lot with understanding the chapters. I liked the exercises very much and Dr Chuck's style is really catching.
Very Good course after learning python for everybody it will also take you to the little bit deep into the python and you will learn about python library and list and dictionary and many more thing.
this course was much more involved and the detailed instruction was excellent. I am taking notes during videos. I refer to the $10 text book with index when working exercises. thank you great course
Felt like this stepped up a gear - learnt some really 'cool' code and can see how Python can be used to solve a few more complicated situations that in the introductory course. Really enjoying this.
Quiet awesome! I won't write a long review cuz i will keep going towards the next course. Thanks for the teaching staff for repling my questions and thanks for Dr.Chunk for such a wonderful course:)
very nicely conducted. satisfied with contents and professor also.it really helped me with enhancing my Data Structure skills and shifting me for taking another course in COURSERA.THANK YOU COURSERA
This is an excellent course to learn the basics of data structure. Lessons, assignments as well as the teachers let you learn and solve what you need to succeed and to understand every step you make
Fantastic course! Clear, concise, with a lot of great concepts. It really shows Python's power for working with data, and I'm excited to take it even further in the next course. Thank you Dr. Chuck!
This course has taught me about Python data structures in a very simple and elegant way. I highly recommend it for anyone searching for information about that topic in a very organized and easy way.
This course helped me to learn about the data structures of python and everything was explained by the professor very nicely. Thank You to Professor and the entire coursera team for so much efforts.
From 0 to Python Hero, this course gave me the kick start I needed and defined my fundamentals in Python programming. Many thanks to Dr. Chuck #personalhero and the entire Coursera team & community.
Thank you Professor Severance,I enjoyed learning Python.  Your approach to teaching: lecture, example, homework and hints to homework, combined to make taking your class a great learning experience.
Interesting course for  a beginner. Took me some time to match the puzzles in programming world. A lot of hiccups along the way but thanks for Professor Charles making everything clear and consise.
Dr. Chuck is an outstanding instructor!! He really gets how it's like to be a beginner and explains things in a simple and clear way.  He brings a lot of energy to the course and also makes it fun!
Dr. Chcuck expalisn the concepts clearly. I found this course very helpful even though i have experience in programming. Bonus videos at the end of the classes are very good. Thank you Dr. Chuck !!
Self paced course is great stay at home course work.  I recommend to those who want to get ahead with leaving home. Great course and instructor is awesome with step by step explanation to examples.
Mr. Chuck is the best online instructor. He can clear all your doubts, can motivate you easily, very encouraging. I thank him so much for coming up with this course and hope to meet him someday. :)
Possibly the best MOOC I've taken.  Excellent instructor, professionally designed course. Excellent combination of videos, quizzes, and actual coding exercises. Excellent coverage of core concepts.
extreamly recommended course, this is the best online course that i take, dr chuck explain perfect, there is no way that you cant understard, thanks and if you want to take this course do not doubt
Very simple understand the collections. Simple examples catch our eyes. I have never learnt this way; though I had read other programming languages where in I need to concentrate so much to read an
Great course! couldn't believe it when i finished the first one, and now can't believe i even finished the 2nd. This is not at all like the ordinary boring programming courses. Highly recommended!!
Nice continuation from the first course. Though I got to admit that most of my learning for this course came from the e-book the professor wrote as I understand better reading than watching videos.
Very good, attractive course! Thanks Dr. Chuck for interesting, practical and detailed approach in teaching this course of Python! Thanks for humor and professionalism in lectures!Best regards,Alex
At a loss for words. Brilliant course and fantastic instructor that teaches you how to think while programming and how-to attack programming problems step by step while verifying after every step.
Excellent Course to learn about Data Structures in Python that too from very basic. I really loved all the concepts and learned a lot. A must-do course for all the beginners in Python Programming!
Its an awesome course.the instructor is awesome and his classes are very understandable.i thank coursera and Michigan university for this awesome course and i thank dr.chuck  for taking this class
Course is very nice and a person having no knowledge of programming can also understand it completely. However, I also found that there are few interview videos that we can skip to save some time.
It is easy to learn, understandable and great course. The instructor has very great communication and presentation skills and a good style. I reccomend this course for basic python datastructures.
More assignments would be good to get enough hands-on. Assignments should cover all previous concepts in more depth to ensure we keep referring/refreshing on the concepts from the earlier chapters
Chuck's way of teaching is so intuitive and student friendly. Really appreciate all the pain he took in thinking deeply as to how to present his material in such an easy-to-understand way. Thanks!
The course is taught by a great instructor who really goes into the details of every tiny bit of the code we work with. He simplifies everything very well. I would recommend this course to anyone.
This was my 2nd course of specialization in python. Content of the course is really helpful for the beginners like me. Instructor Mr. Charles Severance explained every concept in the simplest way.
It was a great course in which I found very specific and useful information to start immersing in Python programming. Professor Charles Severance is the best until now, at least in my experience.
Python Data Structures is another great course taught by the great
Dr. Chuck, the course introduce you to the basic data structures in
python - Not All the data structures - in a very simple way.
This was a great course! It was well paced, with good practice problems to test yourself. I also really liked the bonus videos, which were interviews of various people of importance in computing.
Thank you so much, Dr.Chuck. Your worked exercises were really helpful for me to understand the code thoroughly and the advice to print after the steps to check what's happening after every step.
I am a fullstack java developer, I am actually learning Python because, I would like to switch to datascience, I found this course very interested, I am enjoying this course. Thank you Dr. Chuck!
Very friendly and effective way to learn Python - course well structured - great pace and comprehensive examples - that gets to the subject to learn without rhetorical explanations or shortcuts -
An excellent course, in content and structure. By the time you reach the final assignments you really do appreciate how much you have learned and how to apply it to practical real life situations
This second Python course included more complex assignments and much more interesting content than the first part of it. I strongly recommend it for those, who interested in computer programming!
This courser is far more challenging than the previous. So be prepared and stick to the problems, makes solving them more satisfying. The problem really combines everything together quite nicely.
Fantastic course for learning and implementing data structures in Python.  I now feel like I have a healthy grasp as to how to scrub, analyze and implement data through various methods in Python.
For the love of God, you have to learn python from Professor Charles Severance as he is an absolute genius in the way he teaches this entire course. Highly recommended for all to come and do it.
An excillent course that covers all data structures like list, tuples, strings and dicitionaries in an excellent teaching style of Dr. Chuck. It was a great experience learning from this course.
A great way to keep learning in basic Python data structures. Charles makes it really easy to understand and for somebody with no programming language background whatsoever it is a great course.
The pace and detail level of this course is perfect.   I think the course is valuable if you are new to coding or if you are familiar with coding, but want to learn python syntax and structures.
An excellent explanatory course with handson experience.  Though assignments are thoughtful, some more assignments would make us practice more.  Thank you Dr Chuck. Hope to listen in next course
The course is very well structured and easy paced. The lectures by Dr Chuck are extremely comprehensible . It makes programming fun and enjoyable. Looking forward to enroll into the next course.
Thank you Chuck!!I love the final little graduation ceremony, it's so cute!Hopefully I will begin the next session with you very soon.BTW, I got the same Harry Potter bottle but it's Gryffindor.
Great course, step-by-step learning. Content is easy to understand and well explained. Videos provide further explanation, if required. If you want to learn Python by yourself, get enrolled now!
Was amazing the process to manipulate data from files to obtain something that you need.It really was to powerfull and I`m totally motivated to follow develop these skills and why not share it.
I've learnt how to do some new things from the graded examinations and from the lessons, there are many new things to learn about the concepts of these things and it is a great courses overall.
Wonderful course Dr. Chuck, You taught such a complex concept(from my perspective) in a very easy way and the assignments was just perfect for one to get complete understanding of these topics.
Excellent introduction to Python basics of data collection (lists, dictionaries, tuples), how to use them and manipulate them.  Dr Chuck is excellent in his explanations.  Great sense of humor!
Really nice classes. Help you learn Python programming step by step, and get a bit understanding of data structure. Really interesting, and will keep going with next courses. Thank you so much!
Dr.  Chuck does an amazing job of teaching Python to newcomers. He is very down to earth in his teaching trying to make things as easy as possible for learners. Great teacher with fun attitude.
Awesome course! Teach you how to analyze text files. How work with the lists, dictionaries and tuples! Teach you how to find most common thing in a text file. Great, smart and funny instructor!
I really love the python programming. A big thanks to coursera and my lecturer Dr.Chuck for all the material, quiz and assignments. I'm really looking forward to complete the remaining courses.
This module requires a deeper analysis and concentration, even though it's a little short for the expectations, at the end we get to learn very important coding procedures and problem solving.
Dr. Charlie S Sir is awesome.Want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for sharing such a precious knowledge in a simplified manner,Best course if you are a beginner. Thank you once again!
This course is very friendly yet a little challenge to beginners.  But questions are explained clearly to the audience. I highly recommend this class series to the beginner students of Python.
Thanks so much for putting together another outstanding course. I love the easy to understand building block approach Dr. Chuck uses to teach Python. Excellent course and excellent instructor.
Chuck Severance is the best programming teacher I have ever met.  If you can't understand programming after taking one of his courses you should consider whether programming is really for you.
great course but very basic. For ones with intermediate programming expertise, finish it fast and treat it like a refresher with a different explanation/interpretation of ideas from Dr. Chuck.
Would like to have more exercises and maybe less and shorter videos. However I do appreciate the amount of work that has been put in creating this course but more fun exercises would not harm.
I like this course since I feel that the flow of each chapter. In this case, Dr. Charles Severance really knows how to deliver his knowledge to a novice or beginner, and I thank you for that.
It was great doing this course with coursera . Dr.chuck was good at making things understand and present them in a simple way. I recommend this to everyone and I hope everyone should love it.
absolutely useful the pace of the course is really nice anyone who desires to learn python can easily make use of it everyone just have try the best online python course ever that i have seen
A quick an easy introduction to simple data structures using python. A good intro course both for begginers and for people just wanting to get a hold of python. The previous course is a must.
This is a wonderful follow up to the first Python course by Dr. Chuck.The course makes light work of Data Structures and doesn't make them seem as intimidating as they otherwise would. Thanks
easy and good overview. assignments fit the material well but also not too challanging in comparison to course level. Great way to get familiar with python or refresh your programming skills.
This was more challenging (and fun) than the first Python class, but if you just stick with it and put your time into figuring it out, you will get it (and it's super rewarding when you do!).
Awesome experience. Dr. Chuck is a good teacher, gives real time examples, walked us through his world  tour. Perfect Videos , sessions.I would give 10/10 for Dr.Chuck , Sir you are the best.
The series is awesome! Dr.Chunk is cool and always make things interesting when describing! The textbook is great as well. Anyway this is an informative courses series, worth to take them all
It was a great experience since I'd explored some unique features of Python.  Using Python Data Structures is really useful in many problems. Also, It will help me to learn A.I. development.
One of the best instructors out there for introductory python. For ever grateful to Dr. Chuck and his humorous personality throughout the course. Looking forward to the next course with him.
The course was amazing , initially I thought  that I will not be able  to complete the Graded assignments  but I am glad i could complete them. It was possible only because of the professor.
A very good course for beginners who wants to dive into the world of python. Dr. Chuck also makes it very enjoyable and easy to comprehend, the assignments are fun to do. Highly recommended.
Nice explanation. This course helps me learn some basics of Python's data structure. I am looking forward to finishing the succeeding courses. Thank you for all of the efforts you have made!
It is a great course, especially those who are not from the computer field. professor chuck severance is truly the best teacher. I didn't find any difficulty even I am from Mechanical Field.
I found this course even better than the previous one, the teacher has also been very stimulating in finding the next path of my studies which is really important, so thank you mister Chuck!
funny, exciting, learing a lot of programming knowledge of Python, as well as some information of computer technology and living staffs.Thank you very much for leading to the area of Python.
Once again a great add on to the previous course. Things are starting to get nice and icky with methods and properties. Also some interesting concepts. Well done with the training material !
This course was very informative and a nice introduction into the Python language. While I had taken a basic university algorithms course (c++), this covered all of the topics in that class!
1.Mind blowing when I learn dictionary with histogram concept2.First  start with "\n" and get into file where I learn  sequence of concept 3.Learn with Dr. Chuck is fun and learnt lot stuff
Dr. chucks is amazing I was always curious about programming but I always look to me like some are for geniuses only. with his courses, I start to fall in love with the idea of programming.
This course is amazing ! Dr. Chuck is a very inspiring and  his communication skills are exemplary because I being only 15 years old was able to understand such a complex topic. Thankyou !!
Accepted Good python course you are at right place. This course helps to learn so many things.  You can easily understand all thing. Given Assignment is perfect for for test your knowledge.
What a great inspiration Dr. Chuck is! I completed this second course in the series and it completes and connects all the dots together. A must for all those who are doing the first course.
I loved the professor for his method of explaining things and way of talking. This should be the first ever course on Python one should pursue if he/she wants to learn this language. Kudos!
Very nice course. A very easy to follow design and a very helpful team of mentors and staff. Will definitely recommend 10/10Thank you all for a wonderful jobBest regardsLahiri Kanth Nanduri
I really enjoyed taking this course and I learned a great deal about  data structures. I was not familiar with any of the topics before and I am glad I took this course. Highly recommended.
Great Course, Little bit challenging but if you follows Dr Chunk Lectures and read the book you will make it,  it took me 1 week to complete this Course, Good Luck and Thanks a Lot Dr Chunk
I really love the teaching style of Dr. Chuck! He is an awesome teacher and explains things thoroughly and clearly. Recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Python data structure!
Dr. Chuck is an excellent instructor. He breaks out Python program into easily digestible chunks and helps his students work through the details at every step. His enthusiasm is contagious.
Dr. Chuck and his crew really make this enjoyable. It's challenging enough to keep you working & thinking, but when you need help you can get it very quickly. I'm really enjoying the class.
Even as someone who has programmed before, this has been a great review. The course also provides a lot of plugs for the holes in my prior knowledge. Not to mention the instructor's great.
This course is really great and I learnt so many things about Python Data structures. and teacher is good at teaching and explaning each concepts by using practical concepts and programms.
A comprehensive course on the basics of Python Data Structures. I was able to review and understand some topics better through this course. Highly recommended for those new to programming.
It is a very useful class. The professor understands that we don't know about the Python and tries to explain everything in a very easy way so that we can follow him. :) Thank you so much!
Clear and concise way to learn.I would say this is the most important of all the other python . Do not rush through this. This is foundational for your data analysis and manipulation later
I love this course. So far I have completed first two courses in Python for Everybody series. The way Dr. Chuck teaches is very efficient. I recommend everyone to go through these courses.
Exceptional course. There are things covered in the lectures that I could not find in the book. I wish they were 1:1 in content covered. I will probably revisit this course as a refresher.
I like the way how simply Charles teaches. He covers all the topics in such a way that the student can understand each and every wrd that he speaks and understand all the topics with ease.
I enjoyed this course and I thought Charles was a wonderful teacher. However, I thought more graded and guided practice would be helpful although I understand that is up to us as students.
This was a really nice, "play-by-play", intro course explaining the basic principles of using Python to create 'collections' (list, dictionaries, tuples). Highly recommended for beginners.
Perfect course to learn programming and nice assisting staff. Encouraging spirit of peers and mentors through the online forums which makes it easy to learn and apply the course completely
Great course covering basically every elementary data structure in python, hoping there's stuff about class, object and various packages in the following courses under this specialization.
I love the course! Everything becomes clear and quite easy. Thank you Dr. Chuck for your manner of teaching, it's really awesome, it keeps students interested and makes them never give up!
Dr. Chuck presents python in an easy to understand yet informative manner. I highlt recommend all of his Python courses to anyone interested in learning Python. I am starting my third.....
The course was very informative and I learned a lot about python's data structure, as well as idioms and patterns that are common in a lot of programming problems, so it was really great.
it was so interesting course . i have finished this course with happy. i would like to say thanks to my lectures  and enstractures for giving this superb course for my knowledge. thanks!!
This is a very help full course for me . I would  like to give thanks to courser a for making such a wonder full platform for students . The way of teaching is fantastic and mind blowing.
This is a good course. Lots of material covered in a fun and interesting way. There aren't much theory, however, but the lecture will get you going, and allow you to do stuff with Python.
I really like the professor and the pace he follows to complete the course. I also like that in contrast with the first curse, he gives you less hints to struggle, which is what makes you
It's a wonderful tutorial and at the same time explanation was quite fantastic. I am looking forward for other tutorial regarding Python. Last but not the least a big thanks to Dr. Chucks
Awesome course on python. it is courtesy of coursera to offer such value education with financial aid. it helped me a lot in grasping the concept of data-structures in python. thanks sir.
I just loved this course. And specially the way how Charles explains things. That kind of explanation makes things way easier to understand. Thanks for having such a nice course available
I found this course really interesting and assignments were challenging. The entire course structure is defined systematically and every part of the course is well descriptive. Thank you.
Spectacular course that will expand your knowledge of Python fundamentals like managing lists, dictionaries and tuples. You will start to feel like more of a programmer after this course!
Excellent teaching and vivid examples to handle the basic data structures of Python. I think it is a very good intruduction for anyone to get down to Python. Wish all the best! Thank you!
This whole series of python courses is better than I could have hoped. I've taken several online courses with a local college, and even without being live, this series surpasses them all.
Very interesting course. If you like Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python), you should keep learning and subscribe to Python Data Structures.I am ready for the next one!
This course will teach you very well no matter how hards or how tricky the topics are but Dr. Chuck knows how to connect to every student who knows a little bit about Python programming.
It's a very useful course with relatively challenging excercises. It gives you the tools to successfully make a program related to data structures such as lists, dictionaries and tuples.
Excellent course, a must to get the detailed working of the basic data structures of python programming, would have loved it even more if there would have be a bit more solved exercises.
Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor. I have tried to learn python in other places, but it was not as exciting as this one. All credit goes to Dr. Chuck for this highly interactive course!
Very good.  I like this course very much as it's not too easy but also the material and assignment are very good for learning and practising.  I really think  I learnt something from it.
It's an awesome course: clearly structured, well explained and easy to follow. Yet it provides the necessary knowledge to be able to solve assignments and proceed to more complex topics.
It was great introducing the data structures of Python and finishing the tutorial part of the specialization.I Will revisit these videos many times to remember all the necessary details.
I'm so happy to audit this course. Thanks a lot that I can have an access to all the materials for free, provided that's it is only necessary thing to get knowlege and improve my skills.
Great introductory course to data structures in Python. Course materials consist of short video's explain key topics, followed by quizzes, assignments and assignment walk through videos.
The tutor is very talented in explaining the basics in an easy to understand way.However, this course turned out to be very easy for me, so I just rushed through the assignments, mostly.
Great Course, the assignments are built in the same level as the lectures, and the fact that the assignment have dependancy on other assignments is great.  it makes practice even better.
Nicely Paced.  A good refresher for those who dropped Python for sometime and good introduction for total newbies.  It is building up nicely ... anxious for the next course.  Classes???
this course build the confidence also the curiosity to learn more very comfort and easy approached coursethe advisors and the teachers are well qualifiedespecially Dr.chuck is amazing .
Thank you Mr.Charles Russell Severance for this course.I am very happy about this course and also learnt knowledge on python data structure.Thank you Once Again.-Best Regards, Karthik.M
I really like and admire the way  Dr Chuck taught this class, the way he found interesting ways to pass messages across. Thank you for taking time out to make a great content like this.
Finally find a systematic learning progrom for Python.  The skill being taught is far from difficult but you can still see the achievement realized and progress being made step by step.
It is a good course that teaches the basic concepts of how to handle text files and use the different functions to manage and process information such as lists, dictionaries and tuples.
Dr. Chuck is awesome! He's making spooky, strange, foreign, intimidating coding very accessible to me with no condescension.Actually very fun to learn. Much thanks to UofM and Coursera!
Great class! I learned a lot about the data structure in python, including string, files, dictionary, tuple. I will continue the next course in the specialization. Thanks a lot to py4e!
hey it's an excellent course for python. do check it out. it goes in a very smooth or rather a comfortable manner. it will be foundation if u wanna go with further courses of this spez.
This course actually makes use of all the basics we have been taught in course 1 of this specialisation series. In this course we finally do something meaningful with our lines of code.
Again an  Excellent course by coursera. I enjoyed a lot doing the assignment of this course. The instructor was also very good. Please can you make some courses on Django and Postgresql
I loved it. It allowed me to learn a lot of very relevant tips and tricks that will help to make my life easier.Thank you very much.Keep up the great work!I can't wait for the next one.
Good learning experience, meeting people and vising different places by DR.Chunk impressed me a lot. I seek a new way of learning and sharing experiences through this program. Thank you
Great course for beginners. Dr Chuck makes understanding Data Structures easy and clear. A nice balance of theory and practice which makes the course extremely engaging and instructive.
Excellent course with in depth explanations. It is well structured. Is learn to programming from very basics to optimum level. It help me to understand details of using data structures.
Excellent course structure! Dr. Chuck is an amazing teacher. Learned a lot from this course that helped me in my studies. Thank you Coursera community for sponsoring me for this course!
This course specification help me learn python from scratch, really enjoy this lecture and the assignment. By now, I think this course is still easy, which make me feel like keep going.
I had a great learning experience with this module. Dr.Chuck is awesome.. The way he allows us to delve into the concepts is truly amazing.Hoping to take next modules from him.Cheers :)
Great course, the explanations  are very simple and he takes the time to be sure that you understand the concepts, the examples are clear and this teacher is the best, very carismatic.
It was the best course so far I have attended in this subject. Professor  Charles Severance teach at very basic level and then after the assignment we could get pretty much confidence.
Prof. Severance has explained all theory and usage of all commands in practice. By it seems like there were practical tasks, by the internet and books provided by prof have a lot them.
Dr Chuck is amazing, and the course material is very friendly for a complete beginner. Could have included more (perhaps optional) coding problems for people who want to practice more.
The course is very best for who want to learn a python from basic with most talented prof cum friend .Thank you University  of Michigan and Coursera and lat but not list Pro. Dr.chuck.
The course was amazing but the name in my certificate is misprinted and as I had done ID verification it is not changing, if you can help me it will really be nice of you.Thanking you.
The course made python very easy to learn and understand it. Thankyou coursera and to the mentor of University of Michigan. Please provide such good free courses during this quarantine
Well organised and comprehensive coverage. The slides and 
explications are kept as simple as possible, but yet do not spare out 
important details - a balance that is hard to achieve.
Really good course for beginners.I started from scratch and learned a lot .The way  Dr. Charles Severance teaches is very effective.It is fun learning python with Dr. Charles Severance
Excellent Preliminary course for getting into Python Data scraping and Data science Fundamentals. Everything is covered -  Strings, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries and their operations.
Very well explained, the most useful topic in the Python. The course help me to understand data structures in most simplest way possible. Keep up the good work. Definitely recommended!
Outstanding course. Beyond my initial expectations. It get right into the inner core of the semantics for manipulating data collections with this beatiful programming language. Thanks!
Absolutely a five star course for someone who wants to give it a shot in python. Professor Chuck is no doubt a great instructor. Love this course and going to continue to the next one!
This is an excellent course, as I had a great time learning through the whole course, each detail of the things cover in this course are well explain in an interesting/humorous manner.
I really learnt  well to apply the concepts of  dictionaries and files in python. Thank u so much. But i would like  you to add more assignments and quizzes. Overall nice experience!!
This is a  fantastic course for beginners and Dr. Chuck's lecture particularly when he describe about traceback error with his voice modulation and his body language keep me unturned.
Great course! I took in total of 4 days to complete course 1 &2 in the specialization. It introduces Python basic algorithm and data structure in a very clear way. Highly recommend!!!
Awesome Course. Prof. Dr. Chuck explained the concepts very clearly.Hands-on assignment session help to apply the concepts learned.Great kick-start to basis of python data structures.
Fantastic course, easy to follow, great structure. The course really helped my understanding of the basics. I look forward to completing the other modules at some point in the future.
I audited this course and found it to be very good.  Would recommend this to anyone looking to learn Python.  IDr. Severance's teaching style and explanations of the methods in Python
Nice course with basic understanding of python data structure. Professor was witty and it made learning so much interesting and made complex things very funny,easy and understandable.
this is of course one of the excellent course in which i had been throughand the graduation video is awesome and i say that ill never ever forget the 8 principles said thank you sirs
Although I'm only auditing these classes I find them excellent and recommend them for anyone interested in learning a new programming language. Kudos to the instructor and materials!
The course is well designed and Dr. Chuck is very passionate about teaching. I can feel that I was being treated as part of his students and I really appreciate the engaging feeling.
It's an amazing course having all the concepts of python data structure explained from basics moreover, practice assignments  helped to assess our knowledge and made learning easier.
I'm very happy that participated this course and gained lots of basic knowledges and skills on Python Programing. It's a high-quality course and wish all of you can enjoy it like me.
One of the best course and Proff.  Charles Severance is really a one of the best mentor, i ever seen and this course is very  important for engineering student  for the career growth
Dr. Severance does an excellent job explaining the material and selecting examples for use in homework. This is my first course on Coursera and I was pleased with how much I learned.
Great course, requires complete knowledge of previous course as that lays as foundation for this course.Dr. Charles is a dexterous teacher, I wish I had been his classroom student..!
I love this course, the lessons are clear and easy to understand and the exercises are challenging but not impossible. Dr.Chuck makes this course interesting and keeps you motivated!
Awesome lecturer, gives everything clear, always wanted to code, but was always afraid to start. This course changed it all for me, thanks to Dr. Chuck. Highly recommend to everyone.
Awesome course - great notes, great lectures, manageable assignments; wish there was more support for assignments or if there is then wish it was more easily / intuitively accessible
Good lessons, interesting assessments. Good for beginner and interesting for who (like me) has already got programming experience as it provides some nice point of view and examples.
This course is definitely the perfect companion to the previous course on Python.To all of the students who completed the first Python course, this is definitely a step worth taking!
Again, great course for learning programming and applying the material in real problems simple enough to continue to reaffirm concepts discussed in course. And professor is still A+!

Thanks to Professor Charles Russell Severance. I learnt a lot from him. His way of teaching is so fascinating and cool. I am looking forward to enroll the next course. Thanks again.
This course really help us to get familiar with the data structure of python it will really help the students to understand the basic knowledge.Plus the assignments are pretty good.
Good experience for me! But it could be better if it can have a summary of the code we learn in each slide so that the learner could quickly pick up the knowledge after a few weeks.
Tutor Dr. Chuck is awesome, course material is quite nice and way of explanation by Dr. Chuck represents the standard of Education that University of Michigan and Coursera provides.
It's feel great and superb being in this class as got to learn many things ....but if could get more assignment question then it really help to pratice and to understand better.....
I love the professor! He makes the learning so much fun. I think it really helps beginner students to develop an interest at the start and become wiling to continue the exploration.
Highly recommend it to people who don't have a programming background. I have programmed before but this is a course that helps you get your feet wet and still do critical thinking.
Great introduction into data structures in python, including lists, dictionaries and tuples. As an useful example you learn how to get a list of the ten most common words in a text.
Excellent course structure and it was very easy to understand. The best part of this specialization is that the lectures, quizzes and assignments motivate to keep you going. Thanks!
The course is very good, but, on top of all, the sense of humor and the excelent mood of the teacher makes this a better experience than I ever had with any other comparable course.
I understand every bits and bytes of the python data structure. The professor teaching this course is the best teacher I have encountered in my life. His teaching style is awesome.
Amazing Instructor and course.I wish I had learned all my previous classes and courses from Dr. Chuck, Great instructor.Note:Please add more coding exercises with complex problems.
Very good, It explains in detail the main data structures, the pace of the class is just right. Maybe I would have liked a little bit more complex examples but anyway they're good.
This was a great follow up to the 1st course in the specialization.  The assignments were a bit more difficult for me, being a beginner, but really help me put everything together.
It was an awesome experience learning this course. I will recommend it to my friends who would like to further study python data structures or build their base for data structures.
The instructor's passion for programming is a huge motivator to learn. The lessons are done at a suitable pace. My only suggestion, would be to provide optional practice questions.
I would like to thank Dr.Charles for his great way of teaching which makes the course more interesting . This is the best online course I have undergone so far . Thanks Charles :-)
Thanks a lot Mr.Chuck, you are amazing instructor which make me be more familiar with python data structure and become more stronger with python as a programming language. it's FUN

Dr. Chuck is a charismatic and dynamic teacher. His lectures were great fun and simply taught. Everything was lucidly explained and thats what made this course so amazing for me.
One of the best courses I have taken by far. Everything from the videos to assignments is amazing and informative. It has helped me tremendously. I encourage everyone to take it.
A big Thanks To Dr.Chuck to become best instructor and learning is so fun and easy i love this course and am going to complete all five courses and i want to become python expert
Hello, if you are searching some courses to learn about strings, dictionaries, lists, tuples I advise you to take this course! You will have a strong base after done this course.
Excellent course, goes into the depth of Python without making it too difficult for the learners. One would feel confident about programming in Python after finishing the course.
It's great place to begin your programming life with python. I really fell in love with this course and one thing I need from this course is addition of more Homework assignments
This course was my first experience on Coursera that went very well. I learned programming languages (C, Java & MATLAB) but this one was easier as instructor explained very well.
A rewarding experience because I have been able to learn very valuable information. It is an excellent course. It has helped me in the personal and professional field. Thank you.
Although this course is only the second one I have taken in Coursera, but I have to say it is the best programming class I have ever taken in my life. Thank a lot to Dr. Charles.
This is an excellent course. It covers all the main Python data structures, their functions and their use. The teacher presents the material very exciting. You will not be bored!
Easy and understandable explanations from the professor. Programming task difficult enough to make you ponder how to solve the problems. Steady climbing and challenging yourself.
Good no non-sense course. For learning how to program without much theoretical overhead (can be attained later with a greater comfort level), this is a course on the proper path.
Dr. chuck(tutor of Python) made this course so easy i am recommending it even to School children.I learned not only coding here but also technique of teaching and much more.....
Professor "Severus Snape"  ; )   teaches great. His teaching methodology is marvelous.PS: I used to listen to Harry Potter songs while doing assignments, it energies me a lot!!!
The instructor is Amazing. The lectures are lively and interesting, and everything is very well explained. All these factors motivate you to keep learning and take more courses.
A really good course. The instructor was excellent in explaining the materials and the programming assignments were challenging , hence pushing us to extend our thinking horizon
Thank you Dr. Chuck! After this course and the Getting Started with Python course, I feel like a have a strong base for diving in to more sophisticated common Python techniques.
I knew a few things about data structures before enrolling. I have learned a lot of new things from this one. I recommend this course who are looking for python beginner course.
This course was too much helpful for me to understand the data structure and write code quicker than before and it also help me to understand the logic behind that type of data.
Dr chuck is one of the best python teacher ever. Learned a lot regarding python in depth.Gain skills required to apply for my master. Thank for making python easy to understand.
This beginner course is designed in a way that everything is interlinked and based on previous concepts. The course pattern is perfect and each and everything is understandable.
Thank you, Charles , for this course! I have pass two first courses of py4e. And what i want to say is i really liked them both. I will continue to learn the next three courses.
Excellent course, easy to understand content alongside Dr. Chuck's interesting and funny explanations  makes it perfect for beginners to Python as well beginners to programming.
This course covers all the basics of python data structures explained in a simple but effective way by Dr.Chuck.This is a must recommended course if you are a beginner in python
An amazing way to be introduced to the programming world through Python.The lessons are on point and you definitely can learn the foundations of programming well in this course.
Dives into the more powerful Python tools, e.g. dictionaries, and provides a fun and applicable approach to learn the concepts.Great building block on Programming for Everybody.
Explains the data structures in Python in great detail. Highly recommended if you are just getting started with Python. Especially loved the graduation ceremony towards the end!
It is useful course, i have learn many things about Python. here is my advice, i think the exercise are easy to solve, so i hope you can increase the complexity of the exercise.
Very thorough instructor, does a great job of explaining Python data structures in a way that can be useful to intermediate programmers and beginners alike.  Highly recommended.
The lecture videos are highly easy to understand and they are very helpful....... the assignments are challenging yet logically easy if you paid attention to the lecture videos
This course was just awesome and very informative. Instructor was friendly and very informative enough.I would recommend that you should learn this course and upgrade yourself.
Really enjoyed it. Clear, well taught, fun, and just challenging enough without being overwhelming. I highly recommend this class. Looking forward to continuing in this series.
Loved the challenging assignments. I will complete this specialization till the end and I hope I will be able to solve more practical life problems once I completed the course.
Excellent course! A very well introduction with various things in python. It is my first time I am taking programing seriously and it has help me a lot to built the confidence.
Each concept was explained beautifully by Prof. Severance.I immediately took some basic programming challenges on Hackerrank and was able to solve them with minimal difficulty.
Excellent course. Awesome explanations as usual. Wish there were more practice problems/homework, but with the amount of free resources available online, this is not a problem.
That's a great course, I learned about algorith and data structure. I knew about Java but Python is a really amazing language and Dr. Chuck is a great profesor. Thanks for all.
The course was altogether great! The most important part is that it builds interest in Python. Looking forward towards more courses with Dr. Chuck, and of course with Coursera.
This course is extension to Python for everybody and is as good as the first course. The chapters in both courses are well aligned and flow very well from the beginning to end.
Very good. The Instructor and slides were very detailed but very easy to understand as well. Would recommend for you to do the first course In the specialization first though.
This course was awesome, about the Data Structures in Python, I think that is very important for beginning as programmer in python. I am very happy to finished it.  Thank you.
This is really a great course for beginners, The course is interesting and teaches python in the best possible way out there not too fast not too slow , Just at the right pace
Very useful course!! I highly recommend this course to everyone. Had a great learning!!I would like to thank Professor Chuck and his staff :)Thank you, Have a happy learning!!
Amazing instruction by Dr. Chuck!  I have thoroughly enjoyed learning the foundations of the Python progamming language in the first 2 courses of this 5 course specialization.
Crisply structured content that make you understand the basics of python data structures.Moreover the r exercises are pretty efficient  for those who are a beginner at python.
The Graduation Ceremony was the best thing ever happened to me in an online course. Dr Chuck is an awesome person. I love to take his classes. It's a ighly recommended course.
The course is excellent for its steady progression, its explanation of how topics fit into the big picture of Python (and programming in general), and its attention to detail.
A more detailed learning course and I must say each chapter was thoroughly covered and nicely explained which made the quizzes and assignments very easy to solve and practice.
Coursera awesome platform to learn .Great  faculty Mr.chunk ,i m thankful to Coursera to gave me such a valuable knowledge about python data structure.Thank you sir Mr. chunk.
Excellent and to the point and so much elaborated that anyone completely new to programming can understand this. The best programming course for beginners as per my knowledge!
This is a very beginner friendly course while still making you ask the right questions. Highly recommended for any non CS students as a stepping stone for more complex courses
Getting into data-structures. Requires significantly more mental effort than the first Python course of the series, but has assignments that nicely build on top of each other.
Liked the course a lot. The textbook and lectures are very helpful. I recommend doing ALL of the exercises in the book, not just the assigned ones, in order to learn the most.
Even if you are an experienced python developer, this course is a good review of the basic data structures. The assignments are great exercises. Dr. Chuck is a good instructor
The instructor explained the topics of the course in a way that is easily understandable by beginners and amateurs in the Python language. Looking forward to the next course.
I'm really enjoying myself in this specialization. The tasks are paced to become as difficult as your skill level is developed and it is very rewarding to see your code work.
As said before about the conduction of such courses UM is by far the best with the tutor's explaination about stuffs related to data structures just made it reach it's zenith
It was a great course to introduce the different kind of data structures in Python. The assignaments were really helpful to practice the skills that we learned in the lessons
Great content, great instructor. This course just begins to get complex, with exercises that go beyond a single algorithm, function, or method to combine them in useful ways.
This is a fantastic course. The lecturer has successfully open the door for me to programming world. He is very good at conduct the course in a way easy to understand. Great!
Really interesting and helpful course, Dr. Chuck is teaching in some really great way. Im satisfied that i took this course, going to take more courses from him about Python.
great course.I am totally new to programming, I do not have any technical education, but I managed to understand the material and I want more.:) Great Job of Prof. Severance.

This professor is literally the best Coursera professor I have had. He explains a potentially intimidating topic in a very approachable way. Keeps it light and digestible.
Great sequel to Python For Everybody, Just the right pacing and excellent explanation for all the objects(strings, lists,dictionaries and tuple) as well as file processing
You should  take this course to upgrade your Python programming skills after you have completed Python for everybody.And one thing Professor Charles is the best professor.
Awesome learnign experience for me and completing the data structure course in python and a good learning experience for myself learnt a lot of techniques with this course
Extremely helpful! Thank you such an amazing course. Although there were some concepts like set and frozen set which could have been covered, the course was very detailed.
Exceptional. I like the content and the pace of the course . it guided me to use data structure in day to day life and helped  me to gain confidence in python. Thank you .
great content, very informative and made me more confident about using python in real_life situations. I am very excited about the upcoming courses in this specialization.
This is a fantastic course presented in a very logical fashion. It was challenging, however the mentors were quick to answer questions and get you through the assignments.
I love the course, I think that in the long run and with a little more depth on the subject I can take advantage of what I learned to be able to develop projects in Python
The professor breaks down this subject matter, and clearly explains what you need to know. I enjoyed his lectures, as they were not dry and he brought life to the subject.
it was fun but sometimes frustrating with the assignments. in the end i love the challenge of trying to figure out what code i'm missing and asking others on their opinion
I really enjoyed the second part of the specialisation and found it really useful- the assignments are really good too, they force you to think and come up with solutions.
This course has been an amazing experience, I've learnt a lot, and Dr. Chuck is an incredible professor, I would recommend this course to whoever want to start programming
The course was really good and I am fascinated by the way they teach us.I am really interested in taking up other courses of my interest offered by University of Michigan.
Dr. Severance is an excellent educator. He starts with very basic concepts and progresses into more advanced topics. He makes sure that everything is explained thoroughly.
Great course,This course was a refresher for me and helped me remember cool little tricks.I highly recommend this course as well as taking it right after the first course.
I truly enjoyed this course.  The lectures were well designed and auto-grader worked well.  The interview materials were great.  Right work load for working professionals.
Many thanks to Dr. Charles Severence for this wonderful course. You are an awesome person sir. No words can express how you CHANGED MY LIFE and how grateful I am to you .
Liked it very much. It is very useful for my own project. I started to understand computer logic. To think about daily routine as a task which I can handle with the code.
This course made data structures much clearer to me. I have taken a Python intensive in the past but I never really felt that I had a solid grasp of this topic. Now I do.
Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples made easy to understand. Quizzes and Assignments were helpful!Its  a good course to build  the fundamental skills required for programming.
The proffesor was extremely successful in explaining tricky concepts in an 'easy to understand' way. I admired the professor's enthusiasm and the level on the assignments

This is the second course of the Python specialization and brings everything you needed to know about basic Python programming, the teacher is fun and knows the material.
Great building block from the Programming for Everybody Course! Challenging at times for someone with no programming experience but definitely worthwhile. Thanks Dr Chuck
The professor is particularly good at explaining. He builds from previous lessons and it's easy to get an understanding of the topic. The pace and content are just right.
I've been in some python courses in my college and from other universities in my country, but this one is the best for understandig how to use python and it's structures
For every individual who is going through the course can understand two things about it. Firstly it is very comprehensible and secondly, it is quite well articulated. :)
Great introduction course for learning python in a short time. I am thankful for Mr.Severance contribution towards teaching this course. Wish everyone enjoy this course.
It's very enjoyable to learn this course if you have the background of programming, I learned JAVA and VBA before so it's quite similar to those object-oriented software
Great and detailed  description of each chapter. I'm glad that everything thought from a very beginner perspective. It helped me to understand and progress much quicker!
Good introductory course, builds effectively on the first one. Really targeted to people with little to no Python experience, but would be very valuable to those people.
I know more about python data structure after taking this course.I absolutely enjoy manipulating the data files. Can't wait to start the third course to access web data!
Good explanations of data collection types that are used in python. Exercises could probably be a bit more challenging, but it will do for absolute beginners. Thank you.
The course is very explanatory, gives the complete details of python and build confidence to start with programming after completion of course.Great work by Prof.Chuck.

Despite that i had already been through several Python Courses but the way Dr.Chuck teach you is amazing.I am very thankful to Dr.Chuck for this amazing Course.
Professor Chuck does a great job of explaining the programming concepts and the needed syntax in Python.  The exercises are great to help confirm understanding.
happy learning, master a lot of new knowledge. Still need a lot of practice. hope can provide some recommended practice website or exercise related to the topic
Hi Dr Chuck, thank you for keeping it interesting. The final assignment almost made me stumble. But going back to the course material finally pulled me through.
I took Fortran IV in 1969, then got into BASIC in 1977, though never got much past the old DOS-based BASIC languages. I'm really enjoying learning about Python.
it is really a good course which is quite applicatable for fresh people to learn a bit deeper during the whole python journey.Thanks for Dr. Chuck and the team!
The instructor covers through the basics necessary and explained in a clear manner. The exercises are really useful to help me understand data structure better.
Excellent presentation of the basic data structures in Python. It includes some hints that might prove extremely useful even for experienced Python programmers.
Excellent training, the teacher surprise me every time with something out of the box,  the interviews he had are amazing! Nice spirit, congrats and many thanks!
The Professor who teaches these courses is amazing.  I really wish he was my professor when I was taking C++.  I would have probably been a software programmer.
A very useful course for learning how to think and code. Through Professor Severance, the Python language gets nearer the learner. No doubts in recommending it.
I have taken different online courses on python programming but none competes with the tutorials in this course. Its the best so far.  Thanks  Charles Severance
An excellent follow on from the Intro to Python. After this I'm very comfortable with the language and looking forward to taking the next courses in the series.
Paced right for a person working a full time job and Dr. Chuck explains the material in an easy to understand fashion.   Well worth the time to take this class.
I love this course because of it my foundation of python programming gets strong and I learned some things in an easy way which are barriers for me in my past.

A very nice course, the professor is amazing and very interesting, the way the course is explained is very comprehensive, just the right way to start in python
This course is a little bit more challenging than the first course in this Specialization, but it's very friendly to people with little programming experience.
the only thing i want to say this course is very very good for the students who just starts programming ...and the instructure is my fav. .he is a fab teacher.
Great Instructors and mentors who are highly responsive, and knowledgable. Even for a person who know nothing about coding the lessons will be understood well.
I finished it, is a little bit harder than the first course, with lots of net challenges. but it is worth in the end  when you are able to complete the course.
I was hoping the course was a little bit longer and also taught the abstract data structures like linked lists, BTS. But for what it taught, it was done great.
Dr. Chuck is so awesome and the online graduation Ceremony was something i didn't expected.Very nice explanations and I am honored to be a part of this course!
It was fun. The course requires bit of more practice than the previous course but I enjoyed it and looking for the next course. Thanks Dr. ChuckYou're amazing.
This and Python for everybody will give you a very basic understanding of the python language and give basic problems to learn how to sift through information.
It is a good specialization course,from the 1 to the 2 ,it is increasingly becoming more difficult,but I know I have made a lot of progress!Thank you Michigan!
Dr. S is a great professor. He made learning data structures fun and informative. I came out of this course understanding more about computers and programming.
