The course is uneven at best, with some modules providing insights and knowledge and others not so much. The presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice. Some of the material, like the lengthy historical review of Edinburgh's vet school, might be good advertising and interesting, but does not fall under the scope of 'what it takes to be a vet'. Good idea, but, with a few exceptions, less than average execution.
This course is taught by instructors with the most monotone of voices.  I literally fell asleep during each lecture. I have worked in the medical field, specializing in cardiology, for 40 years. My love of animals was my reason to explore this course. But I am getting nothing out of it and am giving up on it.
I took it out of curiosity, as I'm already in the profession, and I'm on the fence about this rating.It provides a few introductory lectures about animal care, anatomy, clinical activity and history, which are fairly interesting, but it also leaves out all the difficult sides of the profession (which I think aspiring students _needs_ to know about beforehand).  There is a lot of emotional investment in being a Veterinarian, often you have to walk the fine balance between animal's welfare and owner's economic capabilities, or find yourself before some ethical conflicts. This is a moment with rising attention to vet's issues as burnout, 'compassion fatigue', etc. that mostly stem from the fact our profession is (sadly) not all about animals.  All in all, it is a fun course, maybe a bit of a self promotion from the hosting university (which is understandable and didn't influence my rating), but to me it doesn't deliver on the question: "Do you have what it takes to be a vet?"
Overall I was expecting more from the course. It started off well and then the last few weeks of lectures I felt was random and didn't tie in as well as it could have. I understand wanting to talk about William Dick as it is a part of veterinary history, as well as where this course is from, but it felt like too much information and focus for one week. It would be great to maybe start off this course with a brief history of vet medicine and tools and that's it.There was course material on understanding terms for body components and directionality which is helpful, but then that was it. There was a large part about heart segments which felt out of place. This course is to provide some information to see a glimpse into being a vet. We get shown all the terms for parts of the heart and other organs aren't discussed. Perhaps breaking it up over maybe general organ locations or examples of what being taught without going into specifics for only one part. It felt very odd. That was then followed by respiration and then vet history and it seemed thrown together. Overall I do think there is some great information for people interested to learning a bit of what veterinary students will learn. However, it can be presented in a better format and outline.
Learned a lot about dog breeds but there was no mention of how to treat cats for common  veterinary diseases that they might have. The focus was too much on canines. Also, in some of the quizzes they were asking questions that were  either not covered in any of the lectures or were completely off-topic!
The information presented is largely good. However the course is extremely surface level, will only going into one system (cardio) and will most likely not satisfy the interest of the person typically interested in Vet Med. If you just would like to know what a veterinarian does, and learn a few words, it's a great course. If you would like to know more about body systems in animals and diseases and treatment, you should look elsewhere. Also Coursera: please remove the section on the history of Vet Med, it is insanely boring. There is little of interest there and the discussion is not relevant to the modern day veterinary practice.
I really enjoyed this course, the quizes really made me think and reflect on the knowledge I have been given, I found them very helpful. The course was well laid out and covered a wide variety of aspects regarding Veterinary. The only week which I did not enjoy as much as the others was week 5. I would have preferred to learn more anatomy rather than history.
Some really great weeks but week 2 was very, very heavy in course content and the final week was fairly unhelpful. There was a bit too much unnecessary information on the history of the Vet school that has nothing to do with veterinary medicine.
The beginning is great; it gives you great introductory information on Veterinary skills. However, I found the last part, on Edinburg's Veterinary History, extremely tedious and not relevant for what this course is about.
Though provide a quite high-level overview for vet education, the course is alking more about history and disciplines rather than  knowledge and practice. I was expecting it to be more practical with more examples.
good cource but its medical content  about how to treat disease is  low and needed to be more and clinical cases is low also but another topics is very good
Very interesting course, although lacks course notes. The final test (week 5) had a few questions which weren't covered in the lesson.
this is a really helpful course but I thought it would include more information that would help me to go towards a veterinary future
Good intro, would like to see more info and details on specific subjects, but that might be for the actual medical classes.
I didn't learn very much but it was nice to hear about the history and the heart.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I learned much about myself and have a clearer picture around whether a career in veterinary medicine would still be a good fit for me. (dream I put off #life) I believe a combination of hands on study would help me to further my academic skills within this field. Additionally, I was very challenged in ways I didn't expect and in other areas where I expected a deficiency in my learning there was none. Either way I succeeded and passed my tests and assessments successfully and was able to delve deeper into areas I hadn't dreamed I would. The only suggestion I have is utilization of an interactive video for blood flow through the heart which would be greatly beneficial to many including myself. Thank you for such an engaging and engrossing program.
Nice introductory information. I do wish it had gone more in depth in certain topics, like common diseases, biology, and treatments, but it was a decent first look at vet work. I am glad they covered things like client issues, working with the public, and the structure of exams. I enjoyed the focus on the Dick school's history, and Edinburgh's place in veterinary history. It's cool to see an online course that focuses on the school's unique standing in the topic covered. Thank you for offering this class!
I really found this course quite useful as I was hoping to get an insight into what I would study in vet school and this course has more than exemplified that I am more than willing to learn about veterinary medicine. I understand that this is just a small view of what it is to be an actual veterinarian but is certainly has inspired me to pursue this career.
I HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED THIS COURSE, AND ACCORDING TO TITLE OF THIS COURSE NOW I CAN SAY THAT I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A VETERINARIAN. THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR MY BASIC CONCEPTS AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT. I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE TO OTHER VETS AS WELL. THANKS TO COURSERA...........
Most of the course was great. Some of the videos and techniques were a little awkward and you could tell that not everyone was comfortable being filmed. Overall, the course was beneficial, with perhaps the exception of the history section.
The course was organised very well, and touched on all the relevant topics for an aspiring veterinary surgeon like myself - including areas I didn't anticipate such as clinical skills and EQ.
Really good overview of certain practices but some of the links don't work and the last module isn't that helpful in practice I don't think, but it is interesting
I enjoyed the unique insight this course gave into the veterinary profession and enjoyed the challenge of learning completely remotely through the online format. I also admired the opportunity to learn anatomy relevant to the veterinary profession as opposed to the dry content in school biology. Sadly the final week didn't quite have the thrill of the previous weeks though I admired the history of the Dick Vet school itself. Having the chance to have proof of  my understanding the professional/non-clinical skills will be essential in my vet school application, well done EDIVET team!
Helpful to experience the basic studies and life of a veterinarian. Also good for learning about basic facts on the care of animals that is good to know. I enjoyed quizzing myself to see how I would do. I would have liked to see more about the medical aspect of veterinary practice and advice on how to go to school for it, then to learn about the history of the profession. I liked the course but would have appreciated more information on how to prepare for the career and the different types of jobs that you can take on with veterinary degrees.
This course was extremely interesting. It is at a basic level yet very informative, covering many arras such as pathology, animal care and clinical skills. I would have found it more useful to have more summaries and have facts written down especially for week 5. Overall i really enjoyed this course and believe it has expanded my knowledge of veterinary medicine.
The only thing stopping me from rating 5 stars is that there are questions on the quizzes that are not covered in the lectures or supplementary material. So be sure to have your Google window open and ready during the quiz. Otherwise, I love the course and am happy to give it a 4 star rating for the quality of the lectures.
A nice taster of veterinary courses. However, some information was already review for me from my undergraduate studies in neuroscience and biology, and although the later weeks were new information, I didn't actually learn a lot of new information. But it was a nice refresher and was easy and interesting.
Thoroughly enjoyed this course. The only suggestion I can give is to provide a way through the lecture videos on what information students should pay attention to or highlight. Some of the information I found to be necessary was not on the quizzes. Overall a very informative well put together course!
It was a very informative course with a wide variety of videos and additional resources. The only downside, however, was that in some review quizzes (particularly the one for week 5) there were a few questions on subjects that weren't covered in either the videos or the additional resources provided.
Well, I finished in just 7 days, and I sill am learning the history.... was it really interesting? I may say my interest wasn't particularly in history but I was amazed. I was addicted upto week 3 and then i started slaging off i dont know why... every teachings was extarordinary...Best of my pets
I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found it provided interesting insights into learning veterinary medicine which I haven't obtained from other research and work experience.  Some aspects were quite simple, but overall I think the course gives a good, brief overview of each topic.
Thank you for everything in this course, it open a door for me. I like animals and I like to take care of them, during my career, I always thinking to change my job to become a vet. This lesson give me a lot of consideration about my future career. Thank you.
This was an excellent course to get to grips with what you might come across at university.  It really gives you a good insight and the practice quizzes before the assessments are great - more of those would make the course even better!
Very informative, fun and interesting. Would love to see more of Fram. Maybe transcripts of the video lectures would be helpful for those who don't wish to re-watch whole 15 minute episodes. Thank you for the course!
A worth while course that allows you to get a taste for the subjects and course structure of a veterinary degree and to see what the profession will include, as well as delving in the history of veterinary medicine.
The knowledge share is really good, thought provoking as well as precise and straight to the point. Although, it is very basic, it refreshes your minds on veterinary practice and new things are learnt.
A great introduction to the variety of knowledge and skills a first year veterinary student encounters. Found the content regarding animal care, body systems and clinical skills interesting.
It was a great course with a very good general overview of veterinary studies and the profession. Week 1 definitely could have been broken up into two weeks!
Great lectures and information.  I wasn't terribly interested in all of the Week 5 lessons, but still I definitely acknowledge that history is important.
Very informative and enjoyable. I found it a very good indication of whether or not Veterinary Medicine was the right choice for me!
Really enjoyed it! Though I worry that because you can just re-take the tests as much as you want it doesn't actually "test" you
Great course if you want to know more about the program in Edinburgh. It's also great for those curious about the profession!
i think these types of courses are great for students wanting to enroll in a veterinary school. thanks for all your support.
some videos can be very long making it hard to focus if you just have to listen to someone speaking for the whole video
Very informative, but I think we could have went a little more in depth into hands-on veterinary material.
So great but I found the last module about history of veterinary medicine overly long and boring
Wonderful course! Very useful to anybody thinking of pursing a career in veterinary medicine.
It was an interesting course. I just wish I learned more about medical conditions.
Wonderful. The teachers were amazing and the material was very interesting.
Very Interesting! I am no history buff but rather enjoyed the history beh
the last week about the history was boring but otherwise it was the best
Weeks 1,2, 3, and 4 were good but 5 didn't have much useful information
Some videos are quite long and repetitive but overall, it's fantastic.
good course, but did not understand some of the content in week 2
History of Veterinary Should be the world history of veterinary.
Excellent insight in case you want to become a veterinarian!
a bit of easy@.@   However,brillient for the beginners
Very helpful to get the basic knowledge of a vet.
I Enjoyed taking this course. Very informative.
Its wonderfull experience.very informative
it is great! i have learnt a lot from it.
I enjoy a lot while learning..thank you!
Very interesting and insightful.
First week is the best
My 12-year old daughter who is in 6th grade took this course using my account. Her regular studies were interrupted by the community quarantine imposed in our country. She seized this opportunity to pursue a subject that she is passionate about. Since her first rescued kitten a few years ago, my daughter has dreamt of becoming a veterinarian. She was extremely happy to take this course. She religiously spent her mornings attending her "classes", which she would excitedly report about over lunch! I still recall her animated lecture about the heart of a fin whale! I wish to extend my and my daughter's gratitude for making this course available. You have made her dream of "matriculating" at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies come true! More power to you!
If you are wondering if you want to become a vet or if you only want to learn the base of the veterinarian profession, I greatly recommend this course. I never got bored during this course.
A very good course for students that are interested in becoming a Vet. It pairs with A-level Biology studies very well and gave me a good insight into what the next 5 years will be like.
I loved this course and was pleased that my faulty science was not a huge  stumbling block.  The history aspect of the course provided tremendous context and I cannot agree with students who  might believe it to be irrelevant.   In order to progress to the future, one must always have an eye on the past.  Having said that, long ago I studied the Enlightenment  as  an integral part of a BA in English Literature!  Realistically, I am too old and lacking in science qualifications to become a vet - but were I  to be 35 years younger - I'd strongly consider working hard towards gaining Science A Levels and aim for veterinary school.Nevertheless, I feel that this course has given me some insight as to how to get the best out of  future consultations with my very lovely local  veterinary practice. In addition,  I was pleased to see Dr Andrew Gardiner presenting the final part of the course.  Dr Gardiner's book, The A-Z of Cat Health and First Aid is a wonderful resource, particularly in respect of abscesses, a problem which certain other books only cover  in connection with  dental ailments rather than the  very common problem of abscesses on a cat's back, shoulders and face as a result of fighting!
very interesting! I've been looking at a career change and this course has been an excellent insight. highly recommend.
This course was very interesting and gave insight to the kind of material first year veterinary students would be learning plus history of the profession (mostly the school).  The professors present actual anatomical (dissected) organs and histology slides.  I also thought the husbandry section well done.  The clinical portion is a little weak but understandably, given the medium and safety issues.  I still enjoyed it.  The history portion is a bit too in depth, I feel, and though interesting, spends a great deal of time on the history of the school and founder itself.  They are very enthusiastic though, which is a plus.  The course does a lovely job of presenting some of the various studies that go into this rigorous education/career, such as client interaction, anatomy, histology, animal husbandry, and examination skills.  It is so much more than just a love for animals.  I will certainly look into some of the other animal science-related MOOCs offered by Edinburgh.  I had no difficulty in completing this course in one week although I do have a medical background.
I couldn't have enjoyed this course more. If it had existed when I was in college, I might've chosen veterinary studies. As it is, this course gave a fascinating glimpse into all the different veterinary specializations and their joys and challenges. It was rigorous enough that I felt like I was really learning about animal anatomy and physiology and veterinary care, but not so much so that I couldn't keep up. Also, it gave me a lot of empathy for my cat's veterinarians, with all the challenges and stress they can experience on the job. And a bonus: I learned how cats "smile," and have now successfully traded smiles with my cat!
Great course! My only complaint is that on the last quiz, the information given in the lesson and the quiz questions do not match up, making it a guessing game between two answers on some questions. Such as, the lesson might say something happens between the 1940's and 60's, but then possible answers on the quiz might be 1940-50's or 1950-60's. You get many chances on the quizzes though, so it's really not a big deal, just a nuisance.  The heart and lung anatomy section was explained better in the videos than in my university lectures!
This course is a thorough investigation with an ideal balance of hard science, soft skills, and the medical humanities.When you consider virtual disections, an examination of historical instruments, even an urban archaeological excavation as labs, this course could be the capstone of a specialization from one of the founding institutions of veterinary medicine.The content is designed to   help learners advocate for their health, and their friends' medical care, in clinic. And gives candidates for veterinary school a head start.
Thanks a lot Coursera! This course was very much informative. Becoming a vet was a dream from childhood for me. This definitely serves a base. One can get to know if they truly want to be a passionate vet or can choose some other career instead because taking up this course we can get to learn how vets are trained(just the basics, of course) and stuffs like that. I loved this course and this one will always be close to my heart .
This is a very informative course and I have learnt a great deal. It has cemented my hopes to working with animals. The tutors were very clear and I would like to thank every one of them for their time. Even though I sway towards dogs and horses more, my favourite lecture was the one on Cats in week one, because I think the tutor was incredibly interesting - they all were of course! Thank you SO much 💋
Fantastic course giving a brilliant overview of the key aspects of a veterinary degree/career. It also touches on the academic and emotional intelligence required of vets. A must do for any aspiring veterinarians!
I am a vet student at the UoE, so this was very interesting to me and a great review of everything I have learnt so far + new info on the school's history which I didn't even know before. Great course!
The course has been really fascinating and interesting, covering a variety of aspects in the veterinary profession. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone thinking of becoming a vet in the future.
Really interesting and informative. Professors were helpful and entertaining. Would recommend to anyone thinking about doing veterinary medicine or nursing at university.
Thank you for your very informative slides. This is one step to my dream. and i really want to work with animals and be able to save them.
thanks to ALLAH ALMIGHTY and i appreciate ur efforts ...very fruitful ... thanks
This course was exceptional.  I was fully engaged with the course material for each week, even history - which I wasn't expecting at all!This helped me better understand and appreciate the profession, and has helped me act on pursuing a career in veterinary research - a long sought-after u-turn in my current career.  As it covers a simple introduction into several sectors within the veterinary education, I found a clear interest within health & disease which I will be taking further.The tutors are excellent, and the material at a good level of difficulty to keep you engaged but not overwhelmed.I'd recommend giving this course a try.  If it's something you're passionate about, it's easily worked around a full-time job - and may help you identify a career interest and strength that you wouldn't have realised otherwise.
It is an excellent course for the training of future veterinarians. I am currently a student of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnics, at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. This course helped me a lot for my training as a veterinarian and is a great motivation for Edinburgh veterinarians as well as veterinarians from other countries, especially North America. At the end of my degree, I would like to study a master's degree at the University of Edinburgh and further specialize in other topics of interest in this beautiful profession. I wish you every success.
Hello, good day you have:I think it is an excellent course because it gives us a very broad about what is the career of Veterinary Medicine scene. Thank you very much for making it accessible to the person who wants to take it.

If I may make a suggestion I would like pusierna subtitles in Spanish for people who are not fluent in English.

Thank you very much to the University of Edinburgh, the Dick Vet and veterinarians who developed topics. Much success in any endeavor they undertake. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Sincerely:
Javier Martín Montelongo Montoya from Mexico
A very well presented course that explores the past, present and future of the veterinary profession and gives some insights into how teaching methods are developing today.  Though short, the MOOC gives a broad-spectrum look at many aspects of the Veterinary Medicine course at Edinburgh University that students can expect to cover in greater detail if successful in attaining a place.  I would strongly endorse this course and recommend it to anyone considering a career in veterinary medicine.
It practically helps you figure out if you really want to become a vet, while learning useful things about animals and tips that make someone a respectable professional. I believe that not only future vets, but also owners of pets or animal production owners, benefit watching the course or some parts of it, as they get in the shoes of the vet (especially during week 3) and so they become more conscientious about their pets or animal production !
Very interesting course.  I do not aspire to be a vet (I am a research assistant  an FE/HE education institution farm), but did the course to increase my knowledge of farm animal husbandry.  The section about farm animals was very relevant and interesting, and I found the rest of the course to be fascinating as well.  Highly enjoyable and would recommend to anyone interested in animals, not just in becoming a vet.
I really enjoyed the course, it was especially insightful and gave a lot of information about the veterinary field, as well as some of the background to the field itself. It was very centred around the city of Edinburgh and the development there, which I found to be especially interesting. I definitely recommend this course if you want a small taster for a broader insight into the veterinary field.
PHENOMENAL! That's all I really have to say about this short, yet information rich course! The lecturers in this course are truly great, in the sense that they are able to convey important facts & ideas with relative ease in an easily digestible form for a student!I look forward to more courses from the University of Edinburgh pertinent to veterinary science & medicine! Cheers :D
This was a fantastic course, it really opened up my eyes to what it takes to be a veterinarian and just how much really goes into the study of this speciality.  It really takes a special person to become a vet, there is so much more to it than one would think and this course has shown me just how much I want it. Thank you to everyone involved in making this MOOC available!
This course really helped and encouraged me into studying to be a Veterinarian. Even though I'm not even in High school yet, I found it very helpful. That's not to say that it is an easy course, and that anyone can do it easily-it still gives a challenge for everyone! I'll be sure to thank the Royal Dick University if I ever get the chance to meet any one of their staff.
Very interesting insight into the world of Veterinary Medicine. The final week, focusing on veterinary  history was particularly engaging since it looked at a completely different side of the subject that I had not previously considered. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in animal care and husbandry, as well as the scientific principles underlying disease.
Thank you for such an informative and interesting learning experience. A range of topics were covered in enough detail to feel like you'd learnt something that can be built on in the future. Everything was well explained and the interactive quizzes were very useful. I am now even more excited to apply to study Veterinary Medicine at University.
I have been wanting to pursue a career with animals since i was a small child, and let me tell you, I loved this course. This course gives you the opportunity to get a taste of veterinary school and it is completely free. I can not thank Coursera and The University of Edinburgh enough for giving me this wonderful chance to learn about animals.
As an incoming 2nd year prevet student, this course helped me build up knowledge that cannot be found in a classroom based learning. Also, it is fun to learn things that I will take in my future vet studies in advance as it will give me an insight on how difficult it is to be a veterinarian. Thank you for the course! I really enjoyed it!
The course does provide a good insight in to what modules you may cover in veterinary school. Amazing resources and interesting well done. I really enjoyed completing this course, as I do find the anatomy and physiology interesting, but I am still unsure whether the training and career for veterinary surgeon or vet nurse suits me best.
Fantastic course. Being only fourteen I was worried that despite my passion for veterinary medicine I would find the course too technical yet the accessible videos and interactive script as well as the varied and interesting additional material helped me to develop my understanding and get good grades on the assessments.
This is a great taster course in order to get a realistic insight into what a course in Veterinary Medicine is actually like. For me personally this taster course has further reaffirmed my dream of studying Veterinary Medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies which I have applied for this year.
Brilliant course, thoroughly enjoyed the course and it enhanced my knowledge greatly. Loved the way the lectures were presented and additional material was given. Makes me more determined that ever to achieve my dream of going to vet school and becoming a vet. Highly recommend! Thanks EDIVET!
i absolutely loved this course it provided me with a solid understanding in basic veterinary skills and procedures. it has also helped me to realize that I 100% want to become a vet in the future and continue in this area.thank you so much to everyone who took part in creating this course!
This course provides the perfect insight into the varied fields of study you would encounter at veterinary school. It has been extremely beneficial for me in helping me decide whether to take this subject at university, the videos and resources are so detailed, thoughtful and well made.
This course is absolutely amazing and really broadened my knowledge and understanding about Veterinary Medicine and the Veterinary Profession. I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the course and praise the detail and enthusiasm that was conveyed by all individuals involved. Thank you!
I really enjoyed this MOOC, it gives a good idea of what to expect at school but also as a client. I didn't appreciate being evaluated about the nearby buildings of the school or the name of Dick's sister. Really not the type of thing that would make me chose one vet over the other.
I really enjoyed this course. It not only gave me valuable insights into what I might expect from a formal course in Veterinary science but it also gave me the confidence that I would be able to do it. I highly recommend this course for any prospective vet students out there!
This course went by very fast for me and was so fun as I learned so many valuable informations that will definitely help me in the future! Thank you so much for providing all of this knowledge for free and it was very easy as well to complete plus was not very boring at all.
It was really interesting to learn about the history of veterinary medicine and how it was developed into a profession, especially in European countries. As someone from the U.S., I appreciated learning the aspects of veterinary medicine from a different region of the world.
a brief list of summaries on historical events of veterinarian and Dick college would help in learning the 5th session. Putting questions like those in the final quiz doesn't make as much sense... other quizes are wonderfully set. great entry course to be a veterinarian.
A fascinating overview of anatomy, diagnosis, soft skills, the history and future of veterinary learning and medicine - I loved it and used every possible minute I could spare to watch the lectures.  I loved it and wish I could come study full time at the Royal Dick Vet.
It was a great course. I learnt a lot about veterinary science and how animals are treated, their various anatomy and behaviours and understanding them in a better way. I being an animal lover myself found this course to be really fascinating and interesting. Thank you.
It's my first course involved in Veterinary. This course is very awesome. The order of the lessons are perfectly and very easy for me to catch up. Now I now a lots of stuffs that the veterinarians have to learn in the university. I want to learn some more in Veterinary.
An interesting introduction to Veterinarian Science. I hope it can offers more insights into the different medical specialisations as well as the difficulties vets encounter in the clinics. I really enjoyed revisiting the materials I learnt years ago in Biology classes.
First of all I would like to Thank all of You for the opportunity to learn such an interesting subjects and materials from so brilliant and well-educated teachers!!! It was very interesting and exciting! I learnt new and satisfied very much with this course! Thank You!
It's really feeling like I am a veterinarian student during this course. I have learned how to take good care with animals, also know how to observe my pets in order to speak to the vet. Being a veterinarian was my dream in childhood, the experience was excellent.
This course allows you to assimilate and understand new concepts and skills required in the veterinary medicine industry with ease. On a personal note I, I have really enjoyed all the useful information that this MOOC has offered me and I would recommend it.
This course is great if you are exploring veterinary medicine as a future career. Its a relatively short course and gives you an overview of the career and what will be expected of you. It is a great tool to see if it's something that you really want to do.
Very interesting and full of information! A great start for me as a pre-vet student. It would be helpful if the instructor could offer more English subtitles because there are many professional terms such as species names and diseases in the lecture videos.
I really enjoyed this course! Teaches you skills that are required as a veterinarian as well as background history of the origins of vet medicine that is interesting as well! Would recommend to any for veterinarians or those who are seeking the career!
I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about becoming a vet or is just interested. it was so good I found it hard no to do the whole thing in one sitting. I can't think of one bad thing to say about it it was AMAZING!
Really interesting course.I recommend it to anyone curios about working with animals.This course made me seriously concidering working as a veterinary assistant in the future, I will look at the possibilites of part time studies to achieve this,
Challenging yet extremely interesting and informative. I now feel more secure in my choice to become a Vet in the future as I have thoroughly enjoyed learning all about different aspects including anatomy, clinical skills and veterinary history
Very good and interesting course with well retail explanation making the student encouraged to continue learning. I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the topic. Thank you to all the people who made this wonderful available.
I felt that it gave a good insight to different areas that would likely be covered during a typical first year vet course. I have learnt a lot from this and I would recommend anyone to do it if they are considering taking veterinary medicine!
Thank you very much! I'm starting vet school this year and this course made me sure I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to do. Also, I'm really impressed with the University and the Vet School. I hope someday I can do other courses from you.
An excellent collection of lectures to give a taste of learning veterinary medicine. It feels like you are really with the instructors as they lecture. Very pleased with the course and have dreams of becoming a student of RDCVS one day!
really informative. As an AS level student who wants to pursue vet med, i can guarantee that those whi want to pursue the same will love it. thanks for the great course RDSVS. Looking forward to more vet related courses from you all :)
Iam a Masters in Zoology student, an animal enthusiastic , i was always intrested in knowing more about animal care. The EDIVET course has bought to me a lot of knowledge and helped me to develop my skills in the above platforms.
This course was absolutely brilliant to give you an idea o fveterinary studry. There are easy to follow explanations and good resources available. I would highly trying this course if veterinary is something youre intrested in.
This class has the quizzes to help with the final test witch actually helps to learn the materials and the materials given at the end to print out is a nice additive and helps to memorize the information with out the computer
This was a wonderful course and it built a really strong foundations for my veterinary aspirations! It also set up a basis for some generalised learning which is indipensible and will prove useful over the next few years!
Great course. It really gives an overall approach to being a veterinarian. I would suggest it to anyone who is curious about what a veterinarian does, as well as those who wonder the scope and development of animal care.
Very interesting and well put together. Gives a very broad and basic overview of some topics that will be taught in university, as well as offering some rich history on the development of veterinary studies and practice.
Very interesting and informative course. Given the circumstances, of course, it touches "only" the basics, but even so it allows you to gain useful knowledge and a glimpse at what it's like to study veterinary medicine.
I have learned a lot especially in identifying structures of the heart because I was quite bad at anatomy in our class. Also, the course was informative enough through the general veterinary education and profession.
I have just currently finished week one of this course, but I think it is fantastic! It provides the learner with such a great basic knowledge and understanding of animal care and husbandry. I would highly recommend.
A great overview of the profession and the field, suitable for those considering becoming vet surgeons and vet nurses. Great job of working around the limitations of online learning for such a hands-on subject, too!
I hope to one day apply to RDSVS so this was a great introduction full of interesting lessons and valuable information. Thank you to all the teachers who put this wonderful course together, see you in the future!
This is an exceptional course, I learned about many things that vet students see on their first year at The University of Edinburgh. If you are interested  in veterinary career, do this course without any doubt!
I loved it, it really opened up the question of do I want to do it and do I have what it takes. I fell in love more with wanting to become a vet by learning the history and the old tools that they used to use.
It is very fun, and you learn about a range of animals. The tutorials are great, and having videos of animals and people describing the topic using them, makes it alot more esaier to understnad and remember.
